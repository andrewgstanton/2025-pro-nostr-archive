I’ve been pouring my heart into Continuum — building tools that let us live and work with digital sovereignty.

Every day I’m writing, coding, building, refining, publishing, archiving, and creating a space where our identities, our work, our stories, and our freedom aren’t trapped inside someone else’s platform.

Continuum is:

- **a sovereign publishing tool**  
- **a multi-identity Nostr client**  
- **a personal archive system**  
- **a creative engine for the Bitcoin Chronicles**  
- **a long-term ecosystem for self-sovereign work**

I’m doing all of this independently — without VC money, without corporate funding, without selling control, and without compromising the vision.

If you’ve found value in my writing, conversations, or software, I’d love your support as a patron.

Your support helps me:

- keep Continuum independent  
- build faster  
- expand tools for creators and sovereign individuals  
- release more of the Bitcoin Chronicles  
- publish more theology, sovereignty essays, and long-form work  
- maintain the infrastructure behind the sovereign archive  
- continue developing new features week after week  

**Patron package: $250 (1 time payment)**  
(or sats, with a discount)

If you want to support the work, or you have questions, please reach out:

**Support (including sats):** andrewgstanton@primal.net  

**Questions or DM:** reach out to me directly on Nostr (@Akamaister on Primal)

**For non-sats Patron support payments (Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc.):** DM me and I’ll share the details.

Thank you — truly — to everyone who’s been reading, zapping, encouraging, and walking with me through this journey.

I’ll keep building.  
I’ll keep writing.  
And I’ll keep holding the line on sovereignty, creativity, and truth.
