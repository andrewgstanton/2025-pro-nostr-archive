## v1.2 – Multi-Identity Support & Dashboard Enhancements  
**Release Date:** 2025-07-05

### 🚀 Major Features

- **Multi-Identity Support**
  - Introduced `/api/identities` endpoint to list all identity JSON files.
  - Identity selection modal only appears if more than one identity is present.
  - Identity dropdown sorted alphabetically, with `default` listed first.
  - Users can switch the **signing identity** dynamically from the UI.

- **Decoupled Viewing vs. Signing**
  - Dashboard now clearly separates:
    - 🔐 **Signing Identity**: used for publishing (notes, articles, zaps)
    - 👁 **Currently Viewing**: identity whose events are displayed
  - Added buttons to:
    - Load the current signing identity's dashboard
    - Select another identity's dashboard

### 💄 UI Improvements

- Both NPUB and HEX keys are shown for signing and viewing identities
- Identity nickname is displayed under the signing section
- Dashboard auto-recovers if a session points to a deleted identity

### 🐛 Fixes & Reliability

- Robust error handling for missing or invalid identity sessions
- Prevented crashes when loading stale or non-existent identity files
- Improved fallback logic to default identity if issues are detected

➡️ This version lays the foundation for **multi-NPUB publishing**, fine-grained relay logic, and true sovereign identity tooling in upcoming releases.
