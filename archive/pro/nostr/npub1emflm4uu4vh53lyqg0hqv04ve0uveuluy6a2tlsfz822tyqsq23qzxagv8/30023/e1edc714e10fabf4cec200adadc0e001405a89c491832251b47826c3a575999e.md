# Continuum Changelog

## v1.4.0 – Profile, Article, and Note Management (July 2025)

**Major milestone:** Adds full support for publishing, editing, and deleting notes, articles, and profile metadata — fully aligned with Nostr protocol standards.

### ✍️ New Features

- ✅ **Edit & Republish Articles (`kind:30023`)**
  - Edits are republished as new signed events
  - Old versions deleted via `kind:5`
  - Title, content, tags, and summary are editable
- ✅ **Edit Notes (`kind:1`)**
  - Delete notes with confirmation
  - UI refresh on removal
- ✅ **Profile Metadata Management (`kind:0`)**
  - Add/edit `name`, `about`, `picture`, `nip05`, `lud16`, etc.
  - Publishes signed metadata as `kind:0` event
  - Deletes old profile metadata on update
  - Supports full edit screen or creation fallback

### 🔐 Authorization

- Viewer authorization (`viewer_is_authorized`) used to hide delete/edit buttons
- Partial protection on API routes (will be hardened in v1.4.1)

### 🧱 Infrastructure + Code Quality

- Clean separation of routes:
  - `/api/article/edit/<id>`
  - `/nostr/edit_published_article/<id>`
  - `/api/profile/publish`
  - `/nostr/edit_published_profile/<event_id>`
- Consistent use of `insert_event_to_db()`, `publish_event_to_relays()`, and `generate_event_id()` utilities
- Added `event_id` support to `profiles` table for kind:0 traceability

### 🧪 Bug Fixes & Dev Quality of Life

- Fixed JSON decoding errors on `profile["content"]` field
- Normalized summary handling across article editing
- Added logging for route hits, missing data, and database mismatches
