_Long-term hosting • Permanent archive • Relay-independent memory_

Most Nostr clients can display your long-form posts.  
Very few preserve them.  
None guarantee permanence.

Relays prune. Clients change. Links disappear.  
Your identity — your work — becomes fragile.

**Continuum Pro solves this**, by giving your Nostr identity a **permanent, sovereign archive**, hosted under the Continuum-operated domain:

```
https://nostr.mycontinuum.xyz
```

You maintain full control over your identity and content.  
Continuum stewards the hosting environment.

## 🔥 What Continuum Pro Provides

### **1. A Permanent Archive of Your Long-Form Posts**

Your kind:30023 events are exported into dedicated, immutable year-based archive structures:

```
https://2025.mycontinuum.xyz/archive/pro/nostr/<your npub>/
https://2026.mycontinuum.xyz/archive/pro/nostr/<your npub>/
```

These directories live inside the **shared public Continuum archive**, which includes multiple creators.  
Your npub has its **own dedicated directory**, forming your **portable, self-contained archive subtree**.  
You can copy or mirror your subtree anywhere at any time — it is fully sovereign and relocatable.

Continuum handles:
- hosting  
- domain stability  
- long-term archiving  
- consistent directory structure  

You retain:
- ownership of the content  
- ownership of your npub  
- full sovereignty over signing and creation  

---

### **2. Clean, Permanent Viewer Links (Hosted by Continuum)**

Your long-form writing is readable through a stable, public viewer:

```
https://nostr.mycontinuum.xyz/e/?event_id=<eventId>
```

The viewer is:
- fully static (HTML + JS only)  
- independent of relays  
- independent of Nostr clients  
- permanent for as long as Continuum maintains the domain  

Even if:
- relays forget your events  
- clients shut down  
- the Nostr ecosystem shifts  

…your archive remains readable.

---

### **3. A Public, Permanent Index of Your Work**

Continuum Pro automatically builds a browsable library:

```
https://nostr.mycontinuum.xyz/e/list.html?npub=<your npub>
```

Your archive is:
- grouped by npub  
- grouped by year  
- sorted by timestamp  
- enriched with titles and summaries  
- publicly accessible and linkable  

This becomes the **public library of record** for your Nostr identity.

---

### **4. Included: The Full Local Continuum App (Unlimited Identities)**

Every Continuum Pro purchase includes access to the full current release of the **local Continuum application** (localhost edition).

You get:
- complete sovereignty over your private keys  
- the ability to create, edit, sign, and export long-form posts  
- support for **unlimited npubs** within your local workstation  
- offline-first identity and publishing control  

Hosting is priced per archived npub,  
but **your local Continuum app can manage and publish from any number of identities you choose**.

---

### **5. Access to All Paid Articles**

Continuum Pro members receive **full access to every paid article** published through Akamaister, Continuum and Continuum Magazine.

This includes:
- the entire archive of paid essays  
- all new paid releases going forward  
- PDF versions  
- Markdown versions  
- and canonical event files  

This perk alone exceeds the cost of the Pro package for many readers.

- Bitcoiners and Nostr builders  
- Ministry leaders and teachers  
- Journalists and researchers
