With v1.4 of Continuum, I crossed a threshold I’ve been working toward for months:

✅ Import my LinkedIn data  
✅ Extract the profile, positions, and skills  
✅ Automatically generate a `npub/nsec` identity  
✅ Create and publish a valid `kind:0` event to Nostr  
✅ Make the identity visible — and usable — in the Continuum dashboard

This isn’t just “federated identity.”  
It’s **data liberation**.

I can now carry a representation of my professional profile **outside the LinkedIn silo**, sign and update it with my own key, and use it across any Nostr relay — or platform that respects open data.

The process:
1. Export my LinkedIn ZIP
2. Continuum parses the raw CSVs
3. It generates a `profile.json` and a new `identity.json` (if one doesn't exist)
4. It signs a `kind:0` event with that identity's `nsec`
5. The event is published to multiple relays and visible on Primal, Snort, and more
6. The identity appears in my Continuum dashboard — alongside my others

Even better — the import is **idempotent**. If the profile already exists, nothing is overwritten.

And yes — I still use LinkedIn. But now it's a **relay**, not a prison.

This is just the beginning. Up next:
- LinkedIn article → `kind:30023`
- A resume view in the dashboard
- Possibly zaps and notes from this identity
