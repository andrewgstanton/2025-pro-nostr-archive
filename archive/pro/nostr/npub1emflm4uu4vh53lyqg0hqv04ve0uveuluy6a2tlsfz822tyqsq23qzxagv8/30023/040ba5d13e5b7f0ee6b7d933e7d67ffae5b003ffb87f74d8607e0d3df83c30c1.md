# 👋 Welcome!!

## This is the first post from my new Nostr identity — *Continuum* — signed with a freshly generated npub and published from a local instance of a self-hosted publishing system I’ve been building.

No platforms. No clients. No intermediaries.
Just keys, code, and conviction.

Today is July 4 — and while most of America is celebrating political independence, I want to mark something equally vital:
A declaration of digital independence.

In a world dominated by walled gardens and centralized gatekeepers, publishing from your own machine — under your own identity — is a radical act of freedom.

That’s why I created this system:
A sovereign dashboard for Nostr that allows you to write, edit, and publish both notes and articles from your own computer. You don’t need Primal. You don’t need anyone’s API keys. You just need your own.

This isn’t just a technical choice.
It’s a philosophical one.

We don’t need permission to create.
We don’t need to rent our identities.
We don’t need to ask for reach.

This article was:

Written and published from my local instance

Signed with a new npub generated this morning and manually imported

Sent directly to the Nostr network — bypassing all third-party clients

The name Continuum represents more than a dashboard. It’s a statement:
We can reclaim our tools.
We can own our data.
We can build without asking permission.

Today, I’m choosing freedom.
If you’re reading this — maybe you are too.
