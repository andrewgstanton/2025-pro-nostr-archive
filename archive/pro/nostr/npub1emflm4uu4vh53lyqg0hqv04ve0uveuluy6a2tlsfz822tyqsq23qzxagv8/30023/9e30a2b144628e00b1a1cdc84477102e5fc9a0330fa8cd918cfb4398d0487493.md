# Continuum Roadmap

## v1.5 – Relay Recovery + LinkedIn Dashboard (August 2025)

### 📡 Republish Low-Coverage Events

**Goal:** Ensure important events (notes, articles, profiles) are discoverable across relays.

- Detect events that are missing from key public relays
- Add relay visibility badge per event (already implemented)
- Add a "Republish" button to manually trigger rebroadcast
- Future: schedule auto-rebroadcast for low-coverage events

This ensures that profiles and public content remain accessible without needing to rely on fallback imports from Primal or others.

### 👔 LinkedIn Dashboard (Separate from Nostr UI)

**Goal:** Build a rich, resume-style view powered by `kind:3000` events (non-standard but structured).

- Dashboard path: `/linkedin`
- Use `kind:3000` events for structured data:
  - `work_history`
  - `education`
  - `skills`
  - `endorsements`
  - `recommendations`
- Parsed from uploaded LinkedIn ZIP OR created natively
- Stored and optionally published to relays (opt-in)
- Will NOT interfere with core `kind:0`, `1`, or `30023` Nostr flows

Future goals:
- Enable 2-way sync with LinkedIn via AI agent (not OAuth)
- Turn LinkedIn into an archival “skin” on top of sovereign identity
- Eventually support resume-style PDF export and sharable link

### 📌 Why This Matters

By combining **republishing** with a full **LinkedIn-style dashboard**, `v1.5` ensures that your self-sovereign identity is:

- Fully retrievable
- Rich and professional
- No longer reliant on centralized profile backups like Primal

This moves Continuum one step closer to being a **sovereign identity layer** that can also serve as your **professional root system**.
