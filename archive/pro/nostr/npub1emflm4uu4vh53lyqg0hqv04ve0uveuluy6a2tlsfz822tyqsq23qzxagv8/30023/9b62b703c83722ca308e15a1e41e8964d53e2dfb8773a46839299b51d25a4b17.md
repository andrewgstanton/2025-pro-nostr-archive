# Continuum: Sovereign Publishing in a Post-Platform World
*By Andrew G. Stanton – July 2025*

---

## 🔹 Abstract

Continuum is an open, sovereign publishing protocol built on Nostr. It enables creators, thinkers, and communities to reclaim authorship and identity in an age of platforms, algorithms, and surveillance. Instead of optimizing for engagement metrics or VC scale, Continuum is designed for permanence, interoperability, and self-ownership. This document outlines the problem it addresses, the architecture it builds on, and the roadmap toward open-source release.

## 🔹 1. The Problem

Modern publishing is broken — not for lack of tools, but for excess of control.

- You don’t own your audience.  
- You don’t own your platform.  
- You often don’t even own your words.

Faith-based communities, indie creators, educators, and entrepreneurs have all become renters in someone else’s digital empire. Whether it’s Substack, LinkedIn, or Medium — you’re always one TOS update or shadowban away from losing your voice.

Even Bitcoiners, who champion monetary sovereignty, routinely publish on centralized, surveilled platforms.

The result: **a digitally literate population still living under feudal rules.**

---

## 🔹 2. Continuum’s Thesis

> **Sovereignty begins with identity, and identity begins with authorship.**

Continuum is built to serve this principle:

- 🧑‍💻 A person should own their identity (npub), their content (events), and their publishing infrastructure.  
- 🛠️ Every article, note, or update should be portable across relays and apps.  
- 🪪 Your profile should be editable, auditable, and owned — not assigned by a silo.

Continuum is not a walled garden. It’s a **publishing protocol stack** that rides on Nostr and mirrors the ethos of Bitcoin: open, permissionless, and resilient.

## 🔹 3. Core Capabilities

Continuum builds on three foundational event types in Nostr:

| **Nostr Kind** | **Continuum Use**              | **Notes**                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `0`            | Profile metadata               | Includes nickname, relays, bio  |
| `1`            | Notes and short-form posts     | Similar to tweets/statuses      |
| `30023`        | Articles (long-form publishing)| Markdown-supported, timestamped |

On top of this, Continuum adds:

- ✍️ **Article editing and deletion** via ownership signature  
- 🧼 **Note management** (drafts, archives, deletes)  
- 🧑‍🚀 **Multi-identity support** for managing several npubs  
- 🔐 **View and signing key separation**  
- 🛰️ **Relay presence indicators** (so users can see where events live)

---

## 🔹 4. Philosophy

Continuum is not for “mass adoption.” It’s not trying to be the next Medium or X clone. Instead, it’s for people who:

- Care about owning their digital presence  
- Want to **write outside the algorithm**  
- Prefer permissionless infrastructure over polished platforms  
- Are building in the open, not waiting for permission

It aligns with both the **Bitcoin mindset** (sovereignty, decentralization, skin in the game) and the **early church’s spirit** (decentralized, persistent, and boldly public).

---

## 🔹 5. Roadmap & Open Source Commitment

Continuum is currently live at [mycontinuum.xyz](https://is.gd/kXUhYH), but the vision extends far beyond that hosted instance.

> **Once Continuum hits $10,000 in revenue**, I will open source all code from version **1.1 to 1.5** under a permissive MIT license.

This is not symbolic. It is strategic.

Open-sourcing too early risks fragmentation. Too late, and it breeds dependence. At $10k, the signal is strong: people find it useful. That’s when it’s time to give it back.

---

## 🔹 6. Revenue, Access, and the Open Source Milestone

Continuum currently operates with a **tiered access model** — not to restrict users, but to support sustainability while building toward openness.

- 🆓 **Free Tier**  
  - Read and explore published content  
  - Load and view npub-linked profiles and metadata  
  - Public articles are visible to everyone

- 💼 **Paid Tier**  
  - Create, edit, and delete articles (kind 30023)  
  - Manage drafts and notes  
  - Control profile metadata (kind 0)  
  - Add and switch between multiple npubs  
  - Priority relay syncing and identity presence features

> These features — currently part of the paid tier — represent the majority of Continuum’s **v1.1 through v1.5** functionality.

**Once the project generates $10,000 in cumulative revenue**, all of those versions — including every paid feature released up to v1.5 — will be **open sourced under a permissive MIT license.**

This is a pledge, not a pivot.

Those who support the project early help prove its value — and in doing so, unlock it for the entire ecosystem.

## 🔹 7. Use Cases

- 🗣️ **Public writers** who want permanent authorship under their control  
- 🏛️ **Faith-based orgs** that want to publish without fear of deplatforming  
- 🎓 **Educators and researchers** archiving their work to open networks  
- 🌍 **Global missionaries or community leaders** in censorship-risk zones  
- 🧵 **Indie thinkers** escaping platform constraints

---

## 🔹 8. Why Nostr?

Nostr is the perfect substrate for this kind of work:

- 💡 Simple event structure  
- 🔑 Native key-based identity  
- 🌐 Federated through relays  
- 🧱 Composable and extensible

Nostr is to publishing what Lightning is to payments — lean, open, and unstoppable if done right.

## 🔹 9. The Invitation

Continuum is not trying to scale in the traditional sense. It’s trying to **replicate** — through forks, self-hosting, and extensions. You can run it yourself. You can remix it. You can build with it.

> If you care about digital authorship, this is your platform.  
> If you want to build for the unplatformed church — or the post-institutional thinker — this is your toolset.  
> If you want your publishing future to look more like Bitcoin and less like LinkedIn… let’s talk.

## 🙏 A Final Word

The Gospel spread without platforms. It relied on people, presence, and persistence.

Continuum is an attempt to bring that spirit back to the internet.

We don’t need permission to publish.  
We just need the tools — and each other.
