# July 4,  2025  -  A Declaration of Digital Independence

## 🎆 On July 4, I’m declaring independence — not just from old empires, but from centralized systems.

This is the first post from Continuum — a new Nostr identity I created this morning — and published from a self-hosted system running on my own machine.

No cloud. No middlemen. No platforms.
Just freedom — and a sovereign stack.

Happy Independence Day.
Let’s build something better.
