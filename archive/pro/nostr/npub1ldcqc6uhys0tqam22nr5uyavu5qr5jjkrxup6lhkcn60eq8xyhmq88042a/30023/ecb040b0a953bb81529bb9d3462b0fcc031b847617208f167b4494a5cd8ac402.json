  "content": "*A chronological sovereign ordering of the stories across worlds, eras, and the unfolding continuum.*\n\nThe Bitcoin Chronicles Universe does not unfold linearly.  \nSome stories occur in the near future, others centuries ahead, and others bridge spiritual, emotional, or philosophical dimensions. Because of this, a fixed publication order cannot capture the true sequence of the universe.\n\nThis index establishes the **canonical chronological structure**, with **ARC 1 as the beginning** and **ARC 9 as the latest point in the timeline**.\n\nEach Chronicle is assigned:\n\n- **ARC** → the era in the universe timeline  \n- **SEQ (letter)** → the sequence within that era  \n- **SUB (decimal)** → optional insertions between stories  \n\nExample:  \n**2.C.0** = Arc 2, sequence C, no subsequence.  \n**2.C.1** = a future Chronicle placed between C and D.\n\nThis system allows the universe to expand indefinitely without breaking continuity.\n\nBelow is the **official chronological canon** of the Bitcoin Chronicles Universe.\n\n---\n\n# ⟁ ARC 0 — THE COSMIC FOUNDATIONS\n_Before matter, before time, before the first note of creation — the sovereign architecture of the universe is established._\n\n# 🜁 **ARC 1 — EARLY EXPANSION ERA**  \n_Humanity leaves Earth.
