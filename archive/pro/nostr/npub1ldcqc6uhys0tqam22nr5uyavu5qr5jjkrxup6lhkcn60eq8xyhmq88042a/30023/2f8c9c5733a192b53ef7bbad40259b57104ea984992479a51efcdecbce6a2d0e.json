This piece explores how micro-exits from debt, distraction, and dependence gradually shift a person into a position of freedom, even before circumstances change.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-19 — “Small Exits — Practical Steps to Wean Ourselves Off the Debt-Based System”\n**Teaser:**  \nFreedom from the Babylonian financial order doesn’t come from dramatic breaks or radical withdrawal. It begins with small, realistic, sustainable steps that gradually shift our lives away from debt-dependence and toward sovereignty. This piece outlines practical, concrete actions anyone can begin today.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-18 — “Choosing the Harder Road — The Discipline of Sovereign Building”\n**Teaser:**  \nA deeper, more intimate look at what it actually costs — emotionally, physically, spiritually — to build something sovereign in a world that rewards dependency. This piece explores the tension between exhaustion and purpose, and why choosing the harder road is sometimes the only path that leads anywhere meaningful.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-17 — “Building a Cathedral on Shifting Ground”\n**Teaser:**  \nBehind the public essays and screenshots, there’s a much messier set of tradeoffs: between trading and writing, between properties and Bitcoin, between local software and hosted dashboards, between family expectations and long-term vision. This is a candid look at how I actually plan to navigate 2026.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-14 — ”The Season of Invisible Work\"\n**Teaser:**  \nA long-form reflection on the hidden, unglamorous stretch that comes right before a breakthrough — the season where your work feels fragile, your efforts feel unseen, and every system seems to resist you. Friday’s discouraging discoveries become the framing for a deeper exploration of sovereignty, endurance, and the quiet discipline required to keep building.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-13 — ”When You’re Bone-Tired but Still Called to Build (Field Notes from the Edge of Burnout)\"\n\n**Teaser:**  \nA raw, honest meditation on staying on the field as a sovereign builder when you’re exhausted, undercapitalized, misunderstood, and still convinced you’re supposed to keep going.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-12 — ”The Force Of Freedom\"\n\n**Teaser:**  \nTrue freedom is not the absence of limits but the refinement that comes through covenant — through keeping faith when it would be easier to walk away.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-11 — ”The Covenant of Creation\"\n\n**Teaser:**  \nWritten on our 25th wedding anniversary — a reflection on love, creation, and covenant as the living pattern that sustains both marriage and meaning.\n\n---\n\n## 2025-11-10 — ”The Bitcoin Chronicles — Big Brother Calling: The United Earth Bureau\"\n\n**Teaser:**  \nIn the early 2200s, the United Earth Bureau governs every network, every ledger, every breath of data. Rian Kovács, a compliance inspector, begins tracing a pattern of unauthorized “mirror nodes” that behave like living code. His pursuit leads him to the Bureau’s oldest secret—and the voice that has been calling from inside its own machines.\n\n---\n\n## How to Unlock a Paid Article\nZap **500 sats** → andrewgstanton@primal.net  \nDM me the zap receipt  \nI’ll send you a private link to the PDF.",
