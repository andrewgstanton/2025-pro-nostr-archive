Every creator on Nostr eventually discovers the same truth:

Relays are not archives.  
Clients are not libraries.  
Feeds are not memory.

Nostr is brilliant at *presence* — the real-time pulse of conversation.  
But long-form work, thought pieces, canonical essays, and the kind of writing that shapes a life or a community — these require something more enduring.

They require an archive.

Today, Continuum Magazine is proud to introduce **Continuum Pro** — a permanently archived, sovereign, per-npub publishing ecosystem stewarded by Continuum, designed for writers, thinkers, builders, ministries, educators, and anyone whose work deserves to outlive the volatility of feeds, relays, and clients.

## **A Permanent Home for Your Long-Form Work**

Continuum Pro creates a durable, public, relay-independent archive for your long-form Nostr events (kind:30023), stored in year-based structures such as:

```
https://2025.mycontinuum.xyz/archive/pro/nostr/<npub>/
https://2026.mycontinuum.xyz/archive/pro/nostr/<npub>/
```

Each npub has its **own dedicated directory**, forming a portable, self-contained subtree that can be copied, mirrored, or self-hosted at any time.

Your work is permanent.  
But your identity remains sovereign.

---

## **Readable, Linkable, Relay-Independent**

Alongside the archive lives the Continuum long-form viewer:

```
https://nostr.mycontinuum.xyz/e/?event_id=<id>
```

This viewer is:

- Fully static (HTML + JS only)  
- Publicly accessible  
- Beautifully readable  
- Relay-independent  
- Nostr-client-independent  

It will remain accessible for as long as Continuum maintains its domain — and because everything is stored in open formats, your archive remains portable even if the ecosystem changes.

---

## **A Public Library of Record**

Each npub is automatically added to a browsable index:

```
https://nostr.mycontinuum.xyz/e/list.html?npub=<npub>
```

Grouped by year, enriched with titles and summaries, sorted by time — this index becomes the **public library of your Nostr identity**.

A place to read your work.  
A place to revisit your journey.  
A place to keep your ideas alive.

---

## **Fully Managed Setup**

Continuum Pro is not software you install.  
It is a service: quiet, sovereign, and long-term.

You provide your npub.  
Continuum handles:

- Fetching and exporting your long-form events  
- Building year-based archives  
- Generating canonical JSON  
- Creating viewer pages  
- Updating global index structures  
- Publishing under the Continuum domain  

Your role is simple:  
**Continue creating.**  
Continuum handles the memory.

## **Access to All Paid Articles**

Continuum Pro members also receive **full access to every paid article** published through Akamaister, Continuum and Continuum Magazine.

As part of the Pro package, you gain:

- Immediate access to the entire library of paid essays  
- All new paid releases (delivered privately upon publication)  
- Direct access to PDFs, Markdown versions, and canonical event files  

This alone is worth more than the cost of the Pro package, and it ensures that those who support Continuum receive the full depth of its growing body of long-form work.

## **Why This Matters**

The future needs memory.  
Creators need permanence.  
Communities need continuity.

Continuum Pro isn’t simply a hosting service — it is an architecture for long-form preservation inside an ecosystem built for ephemerality. A bridge between freedom and order, sovereignty and structure.

Your writing deserves a home that will last.  
Continuum Pro provides it.

To begin, DM `@ContinuumMagazine` or `@Akamaister` on Nostr.  
Provide your npub.  
Your archive will follow.
