*A chronological sovereign ordering of the stories across worlds, eras, and the unfolding continuum.*

The Bitcoin Chronicles Universe does not unfold linearly.  
Some stories occur in the near future, others centuries ahead, and others bridge spiritual, emotional, or philosophical dimensions. Because of this, a fixed publication order cannot capture the true sequence of the universe.

This index establishes the **canonical chronological structure**, with **ARC 1 as the beginning** and **ARC 9 as the latest point in the timeline**.

Each Chronicle is assigned:

- **ARC** → the era in the universe timeline  
- **SEQ (letter)** → the sequence within that era  
- **SUB (decimal)** → optional insertions between stories  

Example:  
**2.C.0** = Arc 2, sequence C, no subsequence.  
**2.C.1** = a future Chronicle placed between C and D.

This system allows the universe to expand indefinitely without breaking continuity.

Below is the **official chronological canon** of the Bitcoin Chronicles Universe.

# **Using This Index**

The Chronicle Universe is alive and continually expanding.  
New stories will be placed into **ARC.SEQ.SUB** codes as they are written,  
without disturbing existing continuity or altering previously published arcs.  
This index will be updated over time and maintained as the **canonical reference** for all future eras.

## **Era Glyphs**
Each ARC in the Sovereign Archive is marked with a simple glyph functioning as an *era-marker*.  
These symbols are **purely fictional archival designators** within the Chronicle universe —  
not religious, occult, or esoteric signs.  
They serve only as visual identifiers for different phases of humanity’s sovereign expansion.

**Continuum Magazine** functions as the sovereign archive for the entire Chronicle Canon,  
preserving every arc, every era, and every sequence in durable form.

Across planets, epochs, quantum bridges, and centuries,  
these Chronicles form a single unfolding **Continuum** —  
a sovereign narrative of humanity’s journey  
**from Earth, into the stars, and back again.**
