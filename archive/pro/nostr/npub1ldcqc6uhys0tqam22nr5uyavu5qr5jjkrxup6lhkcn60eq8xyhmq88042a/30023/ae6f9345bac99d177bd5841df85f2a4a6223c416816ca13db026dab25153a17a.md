_A weekly collection of sovereign thought, faith, and conviction._

---

## Editor’s Note

As I release this first issue, my heart is heavy. Wednesday, we lost Charlie Kirk, a leader whose strong 
Christian values and desire for dialogue always resonated with me. And yesterday we remembered Sept 11, 
twenty-four years later. Both moments remind us why freedom, faith, and sovereignty must be guarded, 
lived, and shared.

Across Nostr and even in *Bitcoin Magazine*, tributes poured out for Charlie. What struck me most is 
that many of those voices did not always agree with him, yet they still honored his courage, conviction, 
and personal responsibility. That is the measure of a life that touched deeply, even beyond its own circles.

This magazine will not be driven by headlines alone. It is a witness — week by week, issue by issue — 
to a deeper story of liberty and hope.
