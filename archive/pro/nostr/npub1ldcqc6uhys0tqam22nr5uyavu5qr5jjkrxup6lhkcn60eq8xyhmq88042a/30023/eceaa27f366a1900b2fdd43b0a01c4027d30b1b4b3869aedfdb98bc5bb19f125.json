      "The second issue of Continuum Magazine brings together the Sept 8–14, 2025 writings: one paid article and two free reflections each weekday, with the weekends having 3 articles, all anchored in themes of sovereignty, faith, and conviction. This week we noted the tragic assasination of Charlie Kirk and the observance of Sept. 11.  But, we also launched Continuum Magazine (first issue was published this week)"
