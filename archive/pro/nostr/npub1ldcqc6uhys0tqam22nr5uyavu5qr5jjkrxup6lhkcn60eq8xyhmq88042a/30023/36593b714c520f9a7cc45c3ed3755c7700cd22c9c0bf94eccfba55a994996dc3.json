  "content": "_A weekly collection of sovereign thought, faith, and conviction._\n\n---\n\n## Editor’s Note\n\nAs I release this first issue, my heart is heavy. Wednesday, we lost Charlie Kirk, a leader whose strong \nChristian values and desire for dialogue always resonated with me. And yesterday we remembered Sept 11, \ntwenty-four years later. Both moments remind us why freedom, faith, and sovereignty must be guarded, \nlived, and shared.\n\nAcross Nostr and even in *Bitcoin Magazine*, tributes poured out for Charlie. What struck me most is \nthat many of those voices did not always agree with him, yet they still honored his courage, conviction, \nand personal responsibility. That is the measure of a life that touched deeply, even beyond its own circles.\n\nThis magazine will not be driven by headlines alone. It is a witness — week by week, issue by issue — \nto a deeper story of liberty and hope.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n### Sep 1, 2025\n\n- Paid: *[🔒 Paid Article (Sept. 1, 2025): The Bitcoin Chronicles: Master Timeline of the Bitcoin Chronicles Universe (2025–3100s): A Timeline of Sovereign Labor: From Fiat Chains to the Chain Among the Stars](https://is.gd/ZGA0Yk)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1 (Sept. 1, 2025): Sovereign Labor: The Worker as Creator](https://is.gd/ZLbZpO)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept. 1, 2025): Labor Day in the Age of Inflation](https://is.gd/FYFSlP)*\n\n### Sep 2, 2025\n\n- Paid: *[🔒 Paid Article (Sept. 2, 2025): Cathedrals or Casinos — Bitcoin and the End of Disposable Tech](https://is.gd/ziXMmk)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1 (Sept. 2, 2025): Lessons from Web2 — The Rise and Fall of Disposable Platforms](https://is.gd/OLUdk0)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept. 2, 2025): Web3’s Mirage — Tokens, Ownership, and the Return of Disposability](https://is.gd/P8vQTQ)*\n\n### Sep 3, 2025\n\n- Paid: *[🔒 Paid Article (Sept. 3, 2025) : The Garden Without Walls: How Bitcoin Opens the Way to Human Flourishing](https://is.gd/XbyqMx)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1 (Sept. 3, 2025): The Abundance of Sovereignty: Why Freedom Creates More, Not Less](https://is.gd/sf2Tbo)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept. 3, 2025): Why Hope Belongs to Builders](https://is.gd/06KleL)*\n\n### Sep 4, 2025\n\n- Paid: *[🔒 Paid Article (Sept. 4, 2024): The Currency of Trust: How Bitcoin Restores What Fiat Has Stolen](https://is.gd/BuZFCL)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1 (Sept. 4, 2025): The Generosity of Sovereignty](https://is.gd/4Jaxvm)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept. 4, 2025): Builders of the New Frontier](https://is.gd/pbhYcq)*\n\n### Sep 5, 2025\n\n- Paid: *[🔒 Paid Article (Sept. 5, 2025) : Time, Scarcity, and Human Dignity: Bitcoin as the Architecture of Hope](https://is.gd/YVQIJf)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1 (Sept. 5, 2025): When Patience Becomes Power](https://is.gd/Pb7lIg)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept. 5, 2025): The Horizon Beyond Fiat](https://is.gd/7Mwtlh)*\n\n### Sep 6, 2025\n\n- Sabbath: *[Sabbath Article (Sept, 6, 2025): The Rhythm of Creation and Rest](https://is.gd/Ym7v74)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1( Sept, 6, 2025): Sabbath Rest for a Sovereign People](https://is.gd/Bk92dx)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept 6, 2025): Why Rest Is Resistance](https://is.gd/nbzUaP)*\n\n### Sep 7, 2025\n\n- Sunday: *[Sunday Article (Sept. 7, 2025): Bitcoin and the Renewal of Trust](https://is.gd/Xu8Cee)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 1 (Sept. 7, 2025): The First Day: A New Beginning for a Sovereign Age](https://is.gd/8YcVKx)*\n- Free: *[Free Article 2 (Sept. 7, 2025): Why Hope Rises With the Dawn](https://is.gd/xbZIsv)*\n\n*Additional posts and notes from this week are available on Nostr under `npub19wvckp8z58lxs4djuz43pwujka6tthaq77yjd3axttsgppnj0ersgdguvd` (`@Akamaister`) *",
