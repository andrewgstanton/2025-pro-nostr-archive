One month in.\nStarted posting on Nostr around May 4 when I joined. \n\nDidn’t know what would come of it—just knew I had something to say.\n\nAt Bitcoin2025, I met others who think like I do:\nChristians who see through the hype,\nBuilders who believe in proof of work,\nHumans who still care about truth.\n\nThat confirmed it:\nI’m not here to go viral.\nI’m here to build signal.\nTo post with purpose.\nTo plant seeds of real value.\n\nThanks to those who’ve followed, zapped, or messaged.\nThanks to Dr. C and a few wise friends for helping me stay true.\nEven AI—used rightly—can help amplify a message that matters.\n\nLet’s keep going.\nNot hype. Not hustle. But hope—rooted in reality.\n\n#Bitcoin #Nostr #ProofOfWork #Christianity #Bitcoin2025 #Primal #VictoriousGospel #SovereignSignal",
