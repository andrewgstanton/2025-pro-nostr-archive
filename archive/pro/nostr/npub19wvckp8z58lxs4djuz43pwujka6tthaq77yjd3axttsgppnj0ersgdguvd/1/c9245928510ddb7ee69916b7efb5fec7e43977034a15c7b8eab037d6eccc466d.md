# Sept. 9, 2025

On Sept 9 I published two free reflections: 

- *The Discipline of Self-Sovereignty* 
- *Between Two Worlds: Ministry and Sovereignty.* 

Both explore what it means to live faithfully in tension — to guard personal freedom with discipline, and to navigate the overlapping callings of ministry and sovereignty.
