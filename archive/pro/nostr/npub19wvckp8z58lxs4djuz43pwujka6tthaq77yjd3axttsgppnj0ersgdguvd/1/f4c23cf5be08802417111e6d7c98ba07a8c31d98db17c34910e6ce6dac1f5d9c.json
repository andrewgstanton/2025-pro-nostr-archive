  "content": "Something Changed When I Found Nostr\n\nI never really got into blogging. Social media felt noisy, shallow, performative.\nBut then I found Nostr.\n\nSomething about this protocol flipped a switch for me.\nMaybe it’s the simplicity.\nMaybe it’s the permanence.\nMaybe it’s the way people show up as humans, not brands.\n\nWhatever it is, I’m here now — writing, reflecting, sharing.\nNot to go viral. Not to farm likes.\nBut because it feels real.\n\nAnd honestly? I think that’s what I was waiting for all along.\n\nIf this resonates, feel free to zap — or just reach out and say hi.\n\nPost written with help from ChatGPT.\n\n#nostr #bitcoin #proofOfWork #writing #primal #zapworthy",
