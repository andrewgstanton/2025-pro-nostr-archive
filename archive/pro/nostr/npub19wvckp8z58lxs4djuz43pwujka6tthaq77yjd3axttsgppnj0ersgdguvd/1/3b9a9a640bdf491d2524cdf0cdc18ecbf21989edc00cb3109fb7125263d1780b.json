  "content": "# Christmas Eve (Dec. 24, 2025) - Reflection V — Toward the Stars, Not Away From Earth\n\nWhen I write about humanity going toward the stars, I don’t mean running away.\n\nI mean carrying memory, law, and responsibility farther than before — without pretending we’ve outgrown them.\n\nChristmas reminds us that meaning doesn’t scale by force.\nIt scales by fidelity.\n\n\nThat’s the kind of future I’m trying to imagine.\n\n\n_This reflection is part of a long-form project called Bitcoin Chronicles, published gradually and intentionally._\n\nPeace to you tonight.\n\n(meant to post this Christmas Eve, but it looks like I missed this last one)\n\n\n— Andrew\n\n#BitcoinChronicles #Sovereignty #Time #Waiting #Christmas",
