⚠️ Nostr community PSA

I received a DM from a new, unverified account claiming to represent a major OTC Bitcoin investment tied to a public company. It referenced a $30M buy-in gap on a 5,000 BTC deal and offered me a chance to participate.

The message was unsolicited, lacked verification, and made aggressive claims around affiliations and returns.

Whether scam or just inappropriate outreach, it’s a huge red flag. Be vigilant. Don’t let hype override wisdom.
