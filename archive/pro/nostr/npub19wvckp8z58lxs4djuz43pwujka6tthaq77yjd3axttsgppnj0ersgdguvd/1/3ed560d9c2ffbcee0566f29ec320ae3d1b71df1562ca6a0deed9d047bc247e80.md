Altcoins are the MLMs of crypto.

Flashy branding. Hype-filled whitepapers. Promises of financial freedom if you “just get in early.” Sound familiar?

Multi-level marketing schemes and most altcoin projects operate on the same emotional fuel: scarcity, urgency, and social proof. You’re told it’s not just a product or token — it’s a movement. A chance to build wealth by evangelizing early. But underneath it all, there’s often no real utility. Just cleverly disguised speculation with high churn and low sustainability.

In both systems:
	•	Early promoters profit off later entrants.
	•	The product is secondary to the pitch.
	•	The exit liquidity is you.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin doesn’t need a downline. It doesn’t need a referral link. It doesn’t promise riches — just truth in accounting, final settlement, and uncensorable value.

It’s not exciting because it doesn’t have to be.
It works because it must be.

Bitcoin is opt-in, not recruit-in.
Proof-of-work, not proof-of-hype.

But let’s be honest: some Bitcoin-related projects fall into the same traps.
They mimic altcoins in style — the exclusivity, the FOMO, the yield promises. They dress up trusted infrastructure with MLM-style tactics. And that’s when we start to lose the plot.

If someone’s pressuring you to “get in now,” they’re not selling Bitcoin. They’re selling you.

Bitcoin is different — not because of the branding, but because of the burden.
It asks you to work, to wait, to verify.
It doesn’t promise the moon. It offers the ground beneath your feet.

Let’s build without the hype. Let’s be unshakeable.
Let’s tell the truth — even when it costs us followers, grants, or applause.
