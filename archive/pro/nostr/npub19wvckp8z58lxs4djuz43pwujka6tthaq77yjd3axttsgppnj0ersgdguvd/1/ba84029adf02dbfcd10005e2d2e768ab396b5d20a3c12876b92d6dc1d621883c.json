  "content": "Closing on Pizza Day\n\nBeen writing a lot lately — not for clicks, but to process, reflect, and share what’s been stirring in me.\nThe response so far has been deeply encouraging. A few sats here and there might not seem like much, but to me, every zap is a signal: “I see you. Keep going.”\n\nI’m this close to hitting 1,000 sats by Bitcoin Pizza Day — just 90 to go.\nIf something I’ve written has resonated, feel free to zap and help me cross that line.\n\nNot begging — just stacking. 🍕\n\nPost written with help from ChatGPT.\n\n#nostr #writing #proofOfWork #zapworthy #bitcoin #PizzaDay",
