Mark, I deeply appreciate your vision for a more stable and multipolar monetary system. Your proposal for asset-backed bonds—anchored in gold or Bitcoin—offers a compelling alternative to the current fiat-dominated landscape.

However, I’d like to gently advocate for focusing solely on Bitcoin as the backing asset, for several reasons:

🌍 Bitcoin: The Superior Asset for Global Bonds
Borderless and Digital: Unlike gold, Bitcoin is inherently digital and can be transferred globally with ease, making it ideal for modern financial systems.

Transparent and Verifiable: Bitcoin's blockchain ensures transparent and immutable records, enhancing trust in the backing of bonds.

Scarce and Decentralized: With a fixed supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin resists inflation and centralized control, aligning with the goal of monetary stability.

Accessible and Inclusive: Bitcoin's open network allows participation from anyone with internet access, promoting financial inclusion.

🪙 Gold's Limitations in the Digital Age
Physical Constraints: Gold's physical nature makes it less adaptable to rapid, global transactions.

Centralized Custody Risks: Storing gold requires trust in custodians, which can introduce points of failure.

Limited Transparency: Verifying gold reserves lacks the real-time transparency that Bitcoin's blockchain provides.

In light of these considerations, Bitcoin stands out as a more suitable asset for backing bonds aimed at easing global tensions and promoting financial sovereignty.

I’m eager to continue this dialogue and explore how Bitcoin-backed bonds could be implemented to foster a more equitable and resilient global economy.
