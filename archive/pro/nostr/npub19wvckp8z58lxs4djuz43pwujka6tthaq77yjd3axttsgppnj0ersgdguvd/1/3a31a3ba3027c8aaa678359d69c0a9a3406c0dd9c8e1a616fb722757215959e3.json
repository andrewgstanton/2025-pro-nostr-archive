  "content": "I don’t believe Israelis and Palestinians truly hate each other.\n\nI’ve heard the narratives. I’ve seen the headlines. I know the history is complex and painful.\nBut hate? I don’t buy it — not as the default of the human heart.\n\nMost people don’t want war. They want to live.\nTo love, raise families, worship in peace, and build a future.\n\nThe truth is: most ordinary Israelis and Palestinians do not inherently hate each other.\nWhat they often feel is fear, grief, and exhaustion — emotions stoked by generations of trauma, political manipulation, and systems that benefit from division.\n\nHere’s some perspective:\n\t•\tHatred is rarely organic. It’s taught, inflamed, and reinforced — by media, by leaders, by violent events, and by lack of human contact.\n\t•\tMany Israelis grow up under the shadow of rockets and suicide bombings, taught that Palestinians want to destroy them.\n\t•\tMany Palestinians grow up under occupation, restricted movement, and military presence, taught that Israelis are oppressors.\n\nAnd yet — in moments where people meet, really meet — many discover shared humanity:\n\t•\tIsraeli and Palestinian doctors work side by side in hospitals.\n\t•\tJoint tech startups and peace groups exist — often quietly — bringing people together.\n\t•\tParents who’ve lost children on both sides have formed groups like the Parents Circle-Families Forum, choosing reconciliation over revenge.\n\nWhat we see most often, though, are the extremists — because extremes grab headlines and reinforce the narrative that peace is impossible.\n\nBut the quieter truth is this: most people just want to live.\nTo raise their kids in safety. To have a future. That desire is deeper than ideology. It’s human.\n\nI say this from a unique place. I love Israel — deeply. Spiritually. Historically. Prophetically.\nBut I also feel a strong attraction to Arabic culture — its language, its hospitality, its beauty and soul.\n\nAnd that’s not a contradiction.\nIt’s proof that our world doesn’t have to remain divided.\n\nWe’ve been sold the myth that people must choose sides. That loving one means rejecting the other.\nBut maybe what we really need are more people who can stand in the tension — who carry love for both and are willing to listen, grieve, and hope beyond the headlines.\n\nI believe peace starts with refusing to inherit someone else’s hatred.\n\nIf this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your story.\n\n#SharedHumanity #RefuseToHate #IsraeliAndPalestinian #HopeBeyondHeadlines #PeaceStartsWithin #LoveBothSides #MiddleEastVoices #BridgeBuilders #HealingGenerations #TruthOverTribes\n\n",
