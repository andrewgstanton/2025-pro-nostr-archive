  "content": "⚠️ Nostr community PSA\n\nI received a DM from a new, unverified account claiming to represent a major OTC Bitcoin investment tied to a public company. It referenced a $30M buy-in gap on a 5,000 BTC deal and offered me a chance to participate.\n\nThe message was unsolicited, lacked verification, and made aggressive claims around affiliations and returns.\n\nWhether scam or just inappropriate outreach, it’s a huge red flag. Be vigilant. Don’t let hype override wisdom.\n\n#nostr #bitcoin #opsec #dueDiligence #zaplife",
