# Continuum Pro Teaser

Quick note — I’ve been working quietly on something for months, and it’s finally ready.

It solves a problem I know a lot of us have talked about:  
**how to preserve long-form Nostr posts with real permanence** (even when relays prune or clients overwrite older versions).

@ODELL @fiatjaf — you both care a lot about sovereignty and archival integrity, so I thought you might appreciate this.
