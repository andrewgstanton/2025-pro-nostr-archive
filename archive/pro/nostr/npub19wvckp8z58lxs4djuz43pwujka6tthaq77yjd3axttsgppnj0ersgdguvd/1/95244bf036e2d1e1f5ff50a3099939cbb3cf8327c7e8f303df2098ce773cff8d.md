Just a quick note:

If you zap me or follow me here on Nostr, I’ll follow you back.

Not out of obligation — but out of respect. A zap is more than a tip. A follow is more than a click. They’re signs of presence, attention, and shared signal. And I want to honor that.

This space isn’t about clout. It’s about connection. Quiet signal > loud noise.

⚡️If my posts resonate, feel free to zap — it helps me keep writing and building here.
