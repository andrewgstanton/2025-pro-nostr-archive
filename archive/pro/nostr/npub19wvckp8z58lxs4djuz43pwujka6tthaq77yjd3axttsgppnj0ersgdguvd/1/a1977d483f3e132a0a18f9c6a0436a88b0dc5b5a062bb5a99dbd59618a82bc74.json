  "content": "# Just shipped my first sovereign gated article through Continuum → Primal.\n\nAndrew G. Stanton - August 24, 2025\n\nJust shipped my first *sovereign gated article* with Continuum → Primal.\n\nFlow:\n\n- Public teaser (free)\n- Zap (500 sats)\n- Full article delivered via encrypted DM\n- Backup: the complete Markdown archived in my own encrypted inbox\n\n⚡️ No Substack. No Patreon. No PayPal. Just sats → content.\n\n**Note for Pro users & Patrons of Continuum**:\n\nThis feature is being built into Continuum Pro. That means:\n\n- You’ll be able to write your own gated articles or notes directly inside Continuum.\n- Post a free teaser to Nostr.\n- Set a sats unlock price.\n- When a supporter zaps you, Continuum will handle the flow → deliver the full piece as an encrypted DM, with the option to archive every article automatically.\n\nIt’s a sovereign monetization path: no platforms, no middlemen, just your keys, your npub, and your audience.",
