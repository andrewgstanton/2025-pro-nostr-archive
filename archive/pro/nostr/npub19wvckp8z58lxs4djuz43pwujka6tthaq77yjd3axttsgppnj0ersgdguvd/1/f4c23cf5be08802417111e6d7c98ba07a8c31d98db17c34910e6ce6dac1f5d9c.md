Something Changed When I Found Nostr

I never really got into blogging. Social media felt noisy, shallow, performative.
But then I found Nostr.

Something about this protocol flipped a switch for me.
Maybe it’s the simplicity.
Maybe it’s the permanence.
Maybe it’s the way people show up as humans, not brands.

Whatever it is, I’m here now — writing, reflecting, sharing.
Not to go viral. Not to farm likes.
But because it feels real.

And honestly? I think that’s what I was waiting for all along.

If this resonates, feel free to zap — or just reach out and say hi.
