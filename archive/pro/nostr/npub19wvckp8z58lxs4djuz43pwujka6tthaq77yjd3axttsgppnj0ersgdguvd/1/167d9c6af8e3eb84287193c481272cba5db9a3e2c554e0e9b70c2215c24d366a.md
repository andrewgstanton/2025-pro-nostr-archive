Title: The Price of Transmission

Excerpt / Teaser Text:

“When data crosses the void between Earth and Moon without permission, it does more than send information — it restores faith.

But every act of truth comes with a cost.

For those who built the first Entanglement Bridge, the price wasn’t measured in money or metal — it was measured in courage, secrecy, and the will to keep the signal alive.”

This new Bitcoin Chronicles essay explores what happens when the pursuit of truth collides with the machinery of control — how two scientists risk everything to let a single honest message travel faster than fear.

Why freedom demands payment.
Why hope has bandwidth.
And why every transmission — signed, verified, and sent into the dark — is a heartbeat of human sovereignty.
