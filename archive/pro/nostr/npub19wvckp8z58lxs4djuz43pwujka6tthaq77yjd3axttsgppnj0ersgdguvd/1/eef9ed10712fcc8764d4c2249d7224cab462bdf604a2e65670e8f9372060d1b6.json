  "content": "Part 5 is live: Building Again 🧱\n\nThis is the final post in my 5-part series “Why I Left Web3 for Proof of Work.”\n\nIt’s about starting over. With truth. With conviction. With Bitcoin.\n\nI write about rebuilding after pruning — integrating BTC into my life, business, faith, and even food. It’s not flashy. It’s not loud. But it’s solid. And that’s enough.\n\n✍️ Read:\nhttps://primal.net/andrewgstanton/why-i-left-web3-for-proof-of-work-%E2%80%93-part-5%3A-building-again\n\n⚡ If it resonates, zap a few sats/bitcoin. Every bit goes to building again — without compromise.\n\n🙏 Written with help from ChatGPT (GPT-4) and a lot of reflection.\n\n#Bitcoin #Nostr #ProofOfWork #Faith #Legacy #Regenerate #Sovereignty #BuildingAgain #NoHype",
