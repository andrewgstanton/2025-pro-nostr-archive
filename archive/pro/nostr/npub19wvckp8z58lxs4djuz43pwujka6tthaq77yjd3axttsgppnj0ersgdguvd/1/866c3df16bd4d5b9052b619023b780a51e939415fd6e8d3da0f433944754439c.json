  "content": "So apparently, being a principled Bitcoin maxi means I’m:\n\n✅ Mean-spirited\n✅ Narrow-minded\n✅ Anti-innovation\n✅ Some kind of right-wing goldbug survivalist\n✅ Probably a bigot with a vendetta against unicorns and good vibes\n\nAt least, that’s the caricature.\n\nBecause obviously, if I’m not excited about minting 47 million governance tokens to fund a DAO that pays influencers to raise awareness about a metaverse charity with no working product — I must hate progress.\n\nAnd if I don’t think it’s a great idea to tokenize carbon offsets using a new ERC-42069 token standard approved by the Web3 Foundation and verified on-chain by five anonymous Discord mods…\n…it’s because I’m clearly anti-science and anti-planet.\n\nI get it.\n\nI mean, how dare I believe money should be hard, permissionless, and settled in finality without an “oracle” or “multi-sig council” somewhere in Silicon Valley?\n\nHow dare I want property rights without middlemen, scarcity without marketing teams, and freedom without an app update.\n\nNo, I don’t want to “bridge to Solana.”\nNo, I don’t want to stake in your layer-zero, infinite-scaling timechain that’s “like Bitcoin, but better.”\nAnd no, I’m not early to this new opportunity — I’m just not interested in being your exit liquidity.\n\nHere’s what I am interested in:\n\t•\tOpen protocols with no centralized kill switch\n\t•\tSound money with no foundation attached\n\t•\tCommunities that don’t require a presale to participate\n\t•\tWork that proves value — not vibes\n\nBitcoin is boring. It’s slow. It’s misunderstood.\nAnd it doesn’t need me to evangelize it — it just keeps producing blocks every 10 minutes, whether I post or not.\n\nBut I speak up anyway — not because I’m closed-minded or toxic — but because I’ve seen this story before.\nI bought the tokens. I joined the Discords. I believed the mission statements.\nAnd I watched as “community” turned into “marketing,” “equity” into “exit,” and “decentralization” into just another cap table.\n\nSo if you want to call me a maxi, go for it.\nBut I’d rather be principled than programmable.\nI’d rather be boring than bought.\nAnd I’d rather tell you the truth than sell you a dream.\n\nBitcoin isn’t everything. But it’s the foundation.\nAnd I’m done apologizing for standing on rock while the rest of the house sinks.\n\nOh — and in case you’re wondering how much of a Luddite I really am?\nI enlisted the help of Dr. C (ChatGPT) to craft this post.\nBecause nothing says “anti-tech maximalist” like collaborating with an AI to dunk on altcoins.\n\n⚡️ Like it? Zap me some sats!!\n\n#BitcoinMaxi #ProofOfWork #SoundMoney #ExitTheNoise #BitcoinNotCrypto #PrincipledTech #SignalOverHype #SovereignStack #BuildOnBitcoin #NoICODay #NotYourExitLiquidity #MaxiWithAMission #Web3Detox #Unrugable #OpenProtocols #TruthOverTrend",
