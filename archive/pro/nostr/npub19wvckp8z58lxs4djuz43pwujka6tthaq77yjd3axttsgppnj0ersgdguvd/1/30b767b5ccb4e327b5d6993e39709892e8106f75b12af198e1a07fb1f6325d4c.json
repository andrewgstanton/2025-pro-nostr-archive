  "content": "I don’t fit easily into one box.\n\nI’m a Bitcoin maximalist who collaborates with AI.\nA lover of Israel drawn to Arabic culture.\nA theological thinker writing for tech-savvy audiences.\nA builder who critiques hype — and a critic who still builds.\nA reformer shaped by disillusionment, still choosing hope.\n\nI believe in the Victorious Gospel — not a gospel of fear, but of reconciliation, renewal, and restoration.\nA God who actually wins.\nA future where even enemies become family.\n\nI’m not here to be packaged. I’m here to live and speak truth.\nAnd if that makes me hard to categorize… good.\n\n#VictoriousGospel #BitcoinMaxi #FaithAndCode #BeyondLabels #Reconciliation #TruthOverTribes #NoOneBeyondGrace #BuilderNotBitter #SoundMoney #GospelOfPeace #UnboxedFaith #SovereignStack #KingdomOverChaos #HopeInHardPlaces\n\n",
