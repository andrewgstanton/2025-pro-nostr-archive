  "content": "Everyone Matters—or No One Does\n\nI think I’d treat Jack Dorsey or Michael Saylor the same way I’d treat my neighbor.\nNot because I’m better than anyone—but because I genuinely believe that’s how we’re meant to live.\n\nBitcoin reinforces that.\nProof of Work doesn’t care who you are.\nYour clout, your background, your “following”—none of it matters.\nOnly what you do.\n\nThat’s the world I want to help build.\n\nBut here’s what I’ve noticed—especially in Web3 and even some Christian spaces like CW3:\n\nPeople say the right things.\n“Mission.” “Transparency.” “Community.” “Kingdom.”\nBut behind the curtain, there’s a hierarchy.\nUnspoken tiers. Inner circles. Special treatment for the “visionaries.”\n\nYou can feel it.\nReplies are rationed.\nAccess is based on your visibility, not your heart.\nAnd if you question it—you’re labeled “divisive” or “negative.”\n\nThat’s not truth. That’s branding.\n\nI’ve reached out to some of these folks—not out of neediness, but genuine interest.\nSometimes they respond.\nOften, they don’t.\nAnd that’s okay. I don’t take it personally anymore.\n\nBut it is unsettling.\nBecause it reveals something we don’t like to admit:\nMost people don’t actually want transparency.\nThey want the appearance of authenticity… without the discomfort.\nThey want curated “realness”—as long as it still advances their goals.\n\nBut I’m here for something deeper.\nI’m not here to win at the game.\nI’m here to walk away from it—and help build something better.\n\nA world where your proof of work is your credibility.\nWhere love isn’t selective.\nWhere freedom isn’t filtered by fame.\n\nThat’s the world I believe in.\nAnd I know I’m not the only one.\n\n🟧\n#Bitcoin #StayFree #ProofOfWork #ConvictionNotClout #VictoriousGospel #Nostr #BuildWithTruth",
