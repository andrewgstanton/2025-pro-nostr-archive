# Why I’m writing the Bitcoin Chronicles

The Bitcoin Chronicles are a long-form way for me to explore sovereignty, freedom, and human agency over time — not just as technology or economics, but as culture, story, and belief.

Fiction lets me examine truths that are difficult to approach directly, especially where systems, power, and faith intersect. It’s not prediction or propaganda — it’s a way of thinking honestly, at scale, across generations.
