  "content": "There’s a paradox at the heart of value creation:\n\nIf you chase money, it often slips away. But if you show up to serve — to speak truth, solve real problems, or share a story that needs telling — value has a way of finding you.\n\nI’m not here to monetize. I’m here because I can’t not build, write, and reflect. There’s friction I feel. There’s clarity I want to offer. And somehow, when that’s my posture, the support shows up — zaps, encouragement, connection.\n\n“Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.”\n— Proverbs 22:29\n\n“He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,\nBut he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough!”\n— Proverbs 28:19 (NKJV)\n“Those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty.” — Proverbs 28:19 (paraphrased)\n\nQuiet faithfulness creates lasting fruit. Chasing shortcuts usually ends in shadows.\n\nSo I’ll keep showing up for the signal. The rest is in God’s hands.\n\n⚡️If this resonates, zap away. It helps me keep doing the work.\n\n#bitcoin, #nostr, #proofofwork, #buildwithconviction, #scripture, #valuecreation, #zaplife\n",
