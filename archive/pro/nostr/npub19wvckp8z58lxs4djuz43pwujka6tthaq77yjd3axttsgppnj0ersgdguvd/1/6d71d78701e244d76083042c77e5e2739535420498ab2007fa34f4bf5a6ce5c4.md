Mother’s Day carries both tenderness and joy.

For all us, and me—it’s a day to remember and celebrate the love of our mom, Daphne Chun.

She passed on July 4th, 2011—Independence Day. And in a way, it became her own day of freedom, and a holy mark on our family calendar.

Daphne’s love was not loud, but it was deep. She gave through service, presence, laughter, and food. She was the quiet force that held us, shaped us, and believed in us.

And today, we smile. We remember stories. We share photos.  We laugh like she did. We live in the echo of her love—and that is something to celebrate.

Mother’s Day is also a reminder that God is not only Father—but also like a Mother.

“As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you…”
— Isaiah 66:13

“How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings…”
— Matthew 23:37

In the love of our mom, we glimpsed something divine—something maternal in God that is gentle, nourishing, and strong.

So today we say:

💐 To all who are mothering—thank you.
🕊️ To all who are grieving—grace to you.
🌱 To all who remember—may joy rise alongside the tears.
❤️‍🔥 And to Mom—we see you in each other. We carry your love forward.

Happy Mother’s Day—from all of us who were loved by Daphne Chun.
