Others preach. Some build.\n\nMe?\nI used to wander through Web3—curious, hopeful, but unsettled.\nNow I’m anchored. Not perfect, not loud, but aligned.\nI trade equities. I stack sats. I tithe in Bitcoin.\nI believe Proof of Work isn’t just a protocol—it’s a posture.\n\nI’ve been developing software for over 35 years—but I’ve yet to touch Bitcoin Core.\nI’d like to.\nAnd maybe that’s part of the journey too.\n\nSo I’m asking—not to judge, but to learn:\nWhat kind of Bitcoiner are you?\n\n#ProofOfWork #BitcoinJourney #StackingSats #BitcoinEthos #RealSignal #BuildOnBitcoin #BitcoinPhilosophy #SovereignStacker #NoKeysNoCoin\n\n#BitcoinDev #OpenSourceContributor #BitcoinerVoices\n",
