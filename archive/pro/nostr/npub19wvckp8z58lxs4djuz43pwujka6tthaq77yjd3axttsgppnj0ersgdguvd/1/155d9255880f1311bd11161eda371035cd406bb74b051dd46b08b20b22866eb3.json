  "content": "\n\n🍕 Road to Pizza Day: Feedback + 1,000 Sats Goal ⚡️\n\nI’ve started sharing reflections, stories, and ideas here—just posted the first in a new series. More are coming.\n\nIf anything I post resonates, let me know. Feedback, reposts, questions, even gentle ( or not so gentle) disagreement—it all helps me grow and refine the signal.\n\nAs a small milestone, I’m setting a goal: 1,000 sats zapped to me (currently at 391– 1000  is not a lot about $1.00 currently ) by Bitcoin Pizza Day (May 22).\n\nNot because I’m chasing tips, but because I want to know what’s connecting. Every zap is a signal. If you find value in what I share, zap away. If not, I’d still love your thoughts.\n\n🧡 Thanks for walking this road with me. More coming soon.\n\n\n\n⸻\n\n🛠 Notes:\n\t•\tWritten with help from ChatGPT (ideation, editing, and metrics).\n\t•\tZap if this hits. Ask if it doesn’t.\n\n#BitcoinPizzaDay\n#ZapGoal\n#NostrWriting\n#ProofOfWork\n#ValueForValue\n#BitcoinCommunity\n#ZapIfThisHits\n#1000SatsChallenge\n#FeedbackWelcome\n#LightningNetwork\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/9c5685973d05d7a6e8a08bfa9e6ccfec4731014ee00cb220dc4036f8ebab585f.png",
