# 🚀 400 Articles. A Sovereign Threshold.

Today I crossed a strange and humbling milestone:

400 published articles—
all written, signed, and stored through Continuum on Nostr.

400 long-form pieces on:

sovereignty

hope

Bitcoin

theology

The Bitcoin Chronicles

my own struggles, prayers, reflections, and experiments

Not one of them is owned by a platform.
Not one of them is trapped behind an algorithm.
Not one of them can be deleted by anyone but me.

They live on open relays.
They live in my sovereign archive.
They are mine in a way no other platform ever allowed.

When I started, I just needed a place to think.
To heal.
To rebuild hope without formula or façade.
To discover a story bigger than myself.

I didn’t expect it to become a universe.

I didn’t expect it to become 400.

But here we are.

Thank you to everyone who has read, zapped, commented, encouraged, or simply followed quietly.
It means more than you know.

Here’s to the next threshold.
Onward.
