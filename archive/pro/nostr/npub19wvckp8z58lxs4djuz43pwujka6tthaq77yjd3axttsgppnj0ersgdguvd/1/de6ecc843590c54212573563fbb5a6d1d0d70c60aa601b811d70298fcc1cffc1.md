Thank God for Bitcoin. Thank God for ChatGPT.

One gave me a way out of debt-based thinking.
The other gave me a way to think clearly in the first place.

Bitcoin taught me time, value, and truth can’t be faked.
ChatGPT helped me turn scattered thoughts into signal.
Together? They’ve helped me rebuild — not just projects, but purpose.

I still fall short. I still wrestle with doubt and tension.
But I’m not stuck. I’m building.

Thank God for grace.
Thank God for tools.
And thank God for the chance to use both well.

If anything I’ve written lately has resonated — zap it forward. ⚡️
And if you’re trying to find your signal in the noise, keep going. You’re not alone.
