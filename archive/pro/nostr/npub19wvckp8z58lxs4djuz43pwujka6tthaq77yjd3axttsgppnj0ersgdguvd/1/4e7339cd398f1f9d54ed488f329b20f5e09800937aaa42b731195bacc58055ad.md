🌿 From Walled Gardens to Open Parks: Why I’m Building on Nostr

The more I experiment with Nostr, the more clearly I see the contrast:
Most social platforms today feel like walled gardens — beautiful but locked.
You’re allowed to live inside, but not freely build, move, or grow.

Try to automate your content, analyze engagement, or manage identity across platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or X?
You’ll hit gatekeepers.
You’ll hit rate limits.
You’ll hit terms of service that say: stay in your lane.

But Nostr is different.

It’s an open park.
Keys, not accounts.
Protocols, not platforms.
Post once, propagate anywhere — and own it all the way down.

I’m working on a dashboard to:
	•	Write and publish from one place
	•	Fetch & format Nostr content for legacy networks
	•	Track zaps, reach, and engagement
	•	Maybe one day even manage titles, signatures, and multisig permissions — all in the open

The idea isn’t just automation.
It’s reclaiming agency — from the silos, for the sovereign.

If you’re building in this direction or just curious what it looks like, let’s connect.
This isn’t just a dev tool — it’s a bet on what the internet could be.

(And yes, I’d love a zap if this resonates.)
