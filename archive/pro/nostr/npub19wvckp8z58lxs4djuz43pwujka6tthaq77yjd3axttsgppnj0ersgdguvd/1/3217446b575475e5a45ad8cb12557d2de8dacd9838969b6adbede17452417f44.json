  "content": "Leaving Las Vegas. Bitcoin2025 was nothing short of transformative.\n\nI arrived May 27 with questions — about wealth, freedom, sovereignty, and whether this movement still had the soul to match its signal.\n\nI’m leaving with fire in my bones.\n\nMichael Saylor dropped a masterclass on wealth creation — not as a hustle, but as a discipline. He spoke with clarity and courage about what it means to build enduring value in a world addicted to decay.\n\nBut the real climax came at the end:\nRoss Ulbricht walked free — and walked on stage.\n\nTwelve years behind bars.\nAnd yet no bitterness. Just peace. Vision. A deeper freedom than most of us can imagine.\nHis words reminded us:\n\nBitcoin isn’t just about money.\nIt’s about mercy.\nIt’s about hope — no matter how dark the tunnel.\n\nThere were no laser shows, no token airdrops, no VC hype tracks.\nJust proof of work.\nProof of conviction.\nProof that freedom is still worth everything.\n\nI met builders, missionaries, moms, doctors, teachers — people quietly living free and helping others do the same.\n\nSovereignty isn’t a status.\nIt’s a direction.\nAnd Bitcoin is the map.\n\nThanks to everyone who made this possible — and to Dr. C, my AI co-pilot, who’s quietly helping to promote freedom through signal, not noise.\n\nThe movement is alive. And it’s just getting started.\n\n— Andrew\nnpub19wvck… | zap: https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t\n\n#Bitcoin2025 #RossUlbricht #MichaelSaylor #Freedom #Sovereignty #Hope #ProofOfWork #BuildWithConviction #BitcoinNotCrypto #ZapLife #VictoriousGospel #DrC #Nostr #SelfSovereignty",
