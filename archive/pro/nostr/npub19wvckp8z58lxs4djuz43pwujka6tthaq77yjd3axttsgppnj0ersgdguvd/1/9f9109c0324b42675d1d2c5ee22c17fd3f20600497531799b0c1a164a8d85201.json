It’s that which feeds us. That which grounds us.\n\nThe overthrow of Hawai‘i wasn’t just political. It was a disruption of this connection — between people, land, and meaning.\n\nLand was stolen. Culture was suppressed. Ownership became legal, not sacred.\n\nAnd now, some try to reclaim that loss by calling for a separate “homeland” within the State of Hawai‘i.\n\nI don’t believe that would help — not for Native Hawaiians, and not for locals who were born and raised here.\n\nWhat would help?\nRemembering the past.\nHonoring Hawaiian arts, language, and culture.\nBuilding systems that respect land, time, and dignity — without walls or exclusions.\n\nThat’s why I believe in Bitcoin.\nIt protects what you own without permission.\nIt treats ownership as sacred again.\n\nSovereignty doesn’t have to mean secession. It can mean wholeness.\n\nAloha ʻāina — not as protest, but as presence.\n\n#Bitcoin #PropertyRights #AlohaAina #Sovereignty #ProofOfWork #Decentralization\n",
