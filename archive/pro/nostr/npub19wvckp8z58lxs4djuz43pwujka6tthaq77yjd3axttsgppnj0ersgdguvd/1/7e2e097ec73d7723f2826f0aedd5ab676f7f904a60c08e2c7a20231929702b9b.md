s Bitcoin Mining Wasteful? A Myth Worth Dismantling

One of the most persistent myths I hear—even from well-meaning friends—is that Bitcoin mining is wasteful or bad for the environment.

Let’s clear the air:

Bitcoin mining doesn’t waste energy. It uses energy—on purpose—to secure the most decentralized, censorship-resistant monetary system humanity has ever seen. That’s not waste. That’s proof of work.

In fact, Bitcoin:
	•	Incentivizes renewable and stranded energy—hydro, wind, flare gas, even volcanoes.
	•	Stabilizes grids by acting as a flexible buyer of last resort.
	•	Can make clean energy more profitable, helping new infrastructure get built in places where it otherwise wouldn’t.

Compare that to the energy used by:
	•	Always-on banking servers.
	•	The military-industrial complex that backs fiat currency.
	•	Consumer habits fueled by inflation and debt.

Those systems burn energy to sustain control. Bitcoin burns energy to build freedom.

Waste is producing something that isn’t worth the cost. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and incorruptible ledger, is worth every watt.

The truth? Fiat is far more wasteful. You just don’t see the cost—because it’s been exported, inflated away, or hidden behind bureaucratic complexity.

Bitcoin makes the cost of trust visible—and pays it in full.

Zap if this resonates!
