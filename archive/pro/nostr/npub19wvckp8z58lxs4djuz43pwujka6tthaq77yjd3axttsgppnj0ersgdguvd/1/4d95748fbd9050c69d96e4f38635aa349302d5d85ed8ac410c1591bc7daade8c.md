Bitcoin is Web3 ?

❌ Bitcoin is not Web3 in spirit, architecture, or culture.
Web3, as commonly understood, refers to:

Smart contract platforms (Ethereum, Solana, etc.)

Dapps, DAOs, NFTs, DeFi, etc.

Token-driven ecosystems with high programmability

Bitcoin, on the other hand:

Was created before “Web3” existed as a concept

Doesn’t rely on tokens, ICOs, or smart contract hype

Prioritizes immutability, security, and monetary integrity

Has a very different ethos: slow, deliberate, antifragile

✅ But some people lump Bitcoin into Web3 anyway
Usually for one of two reasons:

Marketing convenience – they group all blockchain technologies together for fundraising or branding.

Lack of understanding – they assume “crypto = Web3,” so Bitcoin gets thrown in.

⚠️ Why this matters
The Bitcoin community (especially Bitcoin Maximalists) tends to reject the Web3 label because:

It obscures Bitcoin’s core mission: sound money

It associates Bitcoin with speculative projects and vaporware

Web3 culture often chases features, while Bitcoin focuses on principles

Summary:
Bitcoin is foundational. Web3 is derivative.
One is money. The other is architecture for apps.
Calling Bitcoin “Web3” is like calling the U.S. Constitution a mobile app.
