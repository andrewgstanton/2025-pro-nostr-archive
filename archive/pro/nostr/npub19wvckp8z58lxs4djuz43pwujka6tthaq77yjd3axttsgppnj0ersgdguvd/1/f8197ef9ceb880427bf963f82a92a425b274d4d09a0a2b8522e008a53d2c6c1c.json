  "content": "What Is Vibe Coding? (At Least the Way I See It)\n\nPeople throw around the term vibe coding like it’s just shipping fast with a meme and a mood. But for me, it’s something deeper — and a lot more intentional.\n\nYes, I move fast. Yes, I use AI tools like ChatGPT to amplify output. Yes, I try to ship without waiting for permission.\n\nBut when I build — whether it’s a GitHub repo, a post series, or a sovereign stack — I’m not chasing dopamine or trying to be clever. I’m building from conviction.\n\nFor me, vibe coding means:\n\t•\tCoding in alignment with values.\nI build with Bitcoin as my base layer, faith as my foundation, and truth as my compass.\n\t•\tCoding with narrative.\nEvery tool I release — from Nostr signal filters to Continuum — carries a story. Not just what it does, but why it matters.\n\t•\tCoding for people, not platforms.\nI’m not here to feed engagement metrics. I’m here to connect with other builders, thinkers, and seekers who want to make something real.\n\t•\tCoding in public.\nThe act of sharing — raw, unfinished, unpolished — is part of the work. You can’t build trust in silence.\n\nEarlier this month, I turned 60. I’m just getting started.\nYou don’t need to be 25 in SF with an AI startup to build with purpose — and you don’t need to wait for someone to hand you a microphone.\n\nWhether you’re 15 or 50, it’s never too early or too late to make your voice heard.\nNever too late to build what matters.\nNever too late to ship something honest.\n\nThis is Proof of Work, not Proof of Performance.\nThis is how I build now.\nThis is vibe coding.\n\n#bitcoin #nostr #vibecoding #proofOfWork #buildWithoutPermission #sovereignstacker #zapLife #nostrDev #digitalsovereignty #ChatGPT",
