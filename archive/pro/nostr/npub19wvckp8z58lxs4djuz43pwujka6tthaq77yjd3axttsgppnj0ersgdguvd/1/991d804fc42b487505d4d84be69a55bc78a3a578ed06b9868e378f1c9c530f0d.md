# Christmas Eve (Dec. 24, 2025) - Reflection I — Waiting Is Not Failure

Christmas Eve is about waiting.

Not the anxious kind — the kind that trusts something is coming even when nothing looks finished yet.

Bitcoin Chronicles is written in that posture.
It isn’t about speed, disruption, or “what’s next.”
It’s about what endures when we accept delay, distance, and responsibility.

Some things only make sense when you stop trying to hurry them.
