Why spend Bitcoin if it’s going up in value?

Because freedom isn’t just stored — it’s lived.

Yes, HODLing is powerful. It’s defiance against inflation. A long bet on a better system.
But if everyone only holds and never spends, Bitcoin risks becoming just another trophy asset — admired, but unused.

Value isn’t realized only when sold.
It’s realized when you trade freely — without permission, friction, or surveillance.

Spending Bitcoin today doesn’t mean giving up gains.
It means supporting the merchants and builders who make a Bitcoin economy real.
It means bootstrapping the world we want — one sat at a time.

And here’s the deeper truth:
If Bitcoin works like we believe it does, then what you give in sats now will come back around — multiplied by the circular economy you’re helping to ignite.

Stack. Yes.
But also spend.
Not recklessly — but intentionally.
Use Lightning. Tip. Pay a friend. Buy from sovereign businesses.

Freedom is not just a number on a screen.
It’s a way of life.
