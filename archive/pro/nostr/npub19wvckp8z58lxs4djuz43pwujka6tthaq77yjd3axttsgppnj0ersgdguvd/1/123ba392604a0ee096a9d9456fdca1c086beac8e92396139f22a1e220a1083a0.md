A follow on to my earlier post about the new iPhone 16… Got the new iPhone 16 Pro Max. Gorgeous device. No charger.
Just a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box — and zero love for folks without a matching brick.

Solution? I charged it using the cable from my Ledger Nano.
Apparently, you need a hardware wallet to power your Apple wallet. 😂
