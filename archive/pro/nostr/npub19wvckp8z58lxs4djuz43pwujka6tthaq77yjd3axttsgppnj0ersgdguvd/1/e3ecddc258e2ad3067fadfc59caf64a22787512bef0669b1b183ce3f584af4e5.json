Speaking my thoughts out loud helps me reflect with less friction — and paired with GPT-assisted editing, it’s already improving both clarity and output.\n\nAnd it’s not just for writing.\n\nYesterday, I used ChatGPT to help me create new trading metrics I hadn’t tracked before — like:\n\nAverage ROI per ticker (daily)\nAnnualized ROI projections based on daily trading results\n\nI’m still early in all of this, but the shift is real:\nThese tools aren’t replacing my voice or thinking — they’re helping me move faster, see more clearly, and work more freely.\n\nTools don’t replace your identity — they help reveal it, if you let them.\n\n📌 Notes:\n\n* This post was drafted by me and refined using ChatGPT to sharpen tone, structure, and flow.\n* If the post resonates, feel free to zap — I appreciate both sats and honest feedback.\n\n#ChatGPT #VoiceFirst #Dictation #Nostr #Blossom #ProofOfWork #WritingTools #ToolsForThought #Productivity #TradingJournal #ROITracking #Automation\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/91db09f599dce1a3e10c7d3e34310278f0d4144fde0c152d3daa06bb756febf8.png",
