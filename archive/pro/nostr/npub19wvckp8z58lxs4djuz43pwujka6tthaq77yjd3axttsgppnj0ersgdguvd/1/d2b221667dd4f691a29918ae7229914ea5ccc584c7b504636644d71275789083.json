  "content": "What Would the Amish Ask ChatGPT?\n\nMost people approach ChatGPT by asking what it can do.\nBut I think the Amish would ask a different set of questions.\n\nThey wouldn’t begin with productivity or features.\nThey’d start with values.\n\nWhat does this tool do to the soul?\n\nDoes it serve the family, the church, the community?\n\nDoes it bring us closer to the truth—or just simulate it faster?\n\nDoes it help us raise our children—or replace the teacher?\n\nDoes it deepen our wisdom—or just widen our bandwidth?\n\nThe Amish don’t reject every technology—they reject technologies that disrupt the fabric of life they’re trying to preserve. If a tool harms communion, self-sufficiency, or faith, they say no—even if it works.\n\nSo what would they make of ChatGPT?\n\nThey might call it impressive, even useful.\nBut they’d ask what it costs to use it every day.\nThey’d wonder what skills, what attentiveness, what reliance on God gets quietly traded away.\n\nAnd maybe they’d remind us that a tool isn’t neutral just because it’s digital.\n\n⚠️ For the record: I’m not Amish. Never even visited an Amish community. But I admire their discipline, their boundary-drawing, and their quiet resistance to the world’s constant acceleration.\n\nWhat do you think ChatGPT is doing to us?\n\nZap or reply. I’d love to hear your thoughts—even if you use AI to write them 😉\n\n⚠️ For the record: I’m not Amish. Never even visited an Amish community. I probably wouldn’t be comfortable living that way—I’m compelled to build, to tell stories, and I do that through technology. But I deeply admire the Amish commitment to honesty, to discernment, and to living in alignment with what they believe. That kind of coherence is rare—and I want more of it in my own way.\n\n#ChatGPT #Amish #TechnologyAndValues #DigitalWisdom #FaithAndTech #ToolsAndTruth #IntentionalLiving #Simplicity #Discernment #AIReflection #TechEthics #SlowTech #CoherentLiving #MoralCourage #HumanCenteredTech #ModernSimplicity #ZapLife #Nostr #BuildWithConviction\n\n\n",
