  "content": "No Loss Days Since March 14, 2025!\n\n https://blossom.primal.net/4f17b72e6285278f6e5c15efbe52d318dea2cca0c84471b46c65bde06cc458d1.png \n\nIn early March, I experienced a major trading loss—one that forced me to face everything I’d been avoiding about risk, posture, and discipline.\n\nSince March 14, I haven’t had a single loss day.\n\nNot because the market got easier. Because I got clearer.\n\nI started journaling. I tracked every trade. I restructured my allocations—10% to BTC, 10% to direct support.\n\nEvery day since then has been about consistency, clarity, and quiet rebuilding.\n\nI still remember the pain—but I carry it now as proof of work.\n\nThis isn’t a comeback story. It’s a realignment story.\n\nNOTE: To be clear, I ONLY trade equities through an e-trade account, I don't trade cryptocurrencies (I used to).  The allocations are based on total trading gains for the week.  \n\n#trading #bitcoin #freedom #missions",
