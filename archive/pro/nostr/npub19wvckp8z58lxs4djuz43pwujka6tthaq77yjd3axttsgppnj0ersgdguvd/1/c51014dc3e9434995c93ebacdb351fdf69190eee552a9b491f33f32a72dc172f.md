🪧 Day 5 – Ownership Is Sovereignty
Hawaiians had private property rights long before the overthrow.
The Kingdom of Hawai‘i enshrined land ownership in a way that was radical for its time — a monarchy acknowledging the right of the common person to own land.

That right didn’t disappear after annexation.
But over time, much of the land was consolidated — under trusts like the Bishop Estate — and today, most people in Hawai‘i can’t buy the land they live on. They lease it.

Even on Native American reservations — land meant to restore sovereignty — the land is often held in community trusts. It’s not truly private. You can’t just buy a parcel and pass it to your children fee simple.

I don’t believe that helps anyone.

Whether you're Hawaiian or not, born here or moved here —
true sovereignty means being able to own and steward your own land.

Today, I hold a piece of sovereignty in my pocket.
Not a deed, but Bitcoin.

It’s the only truly sovereign property in the world:

Portable

Permissionless

Defended by work, not politics

And while it’s not a substitute for land — it does give us a way to reclaim something deeper. A foundation. A store of time, labor, value.

In a world where nearly every square inch is claimed by governments or trusts… Bitcoin gives us something no one can confiscate.

That’s why I believe this matters — not just for Hawaiians, but for everyone who’s ever longed to build something and pass it on.
