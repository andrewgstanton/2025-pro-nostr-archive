🧠 Thought-leadery (adj.)

Not a real word. But it should be.

Think of it as a Sniglet — a made-up word that should exist, like those gems from the classic SNL skits.

thought-leadery /thôt-ˈlēd-ər-ē/
adj.
Resembling or characteristic of a thought leader, especially in a way that’s overly polished, vague, or heavy on buzzwords and light on substance.

Usage:
“That post was so thought-leadery I almost booked a breakthrough branding call.”

Examples:
– “Let’s co-create value in the authenticity space.”
– “Thoughts below 👇”
– “I help 7-figure founders unlock their scalable story.”

🔎 You know it when you see it.

I’m not here for that.
I’m here for conviction > performance, clarity > charisma, and building with proof of work.

⚠️ And if I ever come across like that in any of my posts — please, I beg you:

SHOUT AT ME: “HYPOCRITE! YOU’RE DOING THE SAME THING BRO!”

We don’t need more thought leaders.
We need more real builders who show up, quietly and consistently.
