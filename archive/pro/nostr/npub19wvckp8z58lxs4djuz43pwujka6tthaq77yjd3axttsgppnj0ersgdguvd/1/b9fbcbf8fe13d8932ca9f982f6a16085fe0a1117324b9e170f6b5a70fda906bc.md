Reconciling the World (and Our Ledgers)

“In Christ God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the ministry of reconciliation.”
—2 Corinthians 5:19

The word “reconciliation” is both spiritual and economic.

In Christ, God reconciled our account—not by denying the debt, but by paying it Himself. He didn’t fudge the numbers. He didn’t cook the books. He settled them—justly and mercifully.

And then He handed us the ministry of reconciliation. That’s more than forgiveness. It’s a calling to restore integrity in every domain—including how we deal with people, power, and even value itself.

That’s part of why I align with Bitcoin.

It's transparent.

It's rooted in truth.

It doesn’t erase the ledger—it settles it honestly through Proof of Work.

The gospel says: “Your sins are no longer counted against you.”
Bitcoin says: “Your work is no longer stolen from you.”

Both are acts of reconciliation.
Both cost something real.
And both invite us to live differently.

So today, I pause not just to worship—but to reconcile:
My heart. My habits. My value systems.
Not with hype, but with truth.
