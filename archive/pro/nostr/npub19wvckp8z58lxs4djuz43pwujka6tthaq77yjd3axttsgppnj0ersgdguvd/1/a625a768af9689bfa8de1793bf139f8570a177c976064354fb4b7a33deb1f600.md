I wrote „The Bitcoin Chronicles - The Series“ as a short 6 part series in Aug 22 of this year 

The Chronicles now contains 100s of articles short stories really 

I didn’t think I would end up writing this much 

I almost feel like I discovered it rather than inventing it

Merry Christmas And Happy New Year to all!!
