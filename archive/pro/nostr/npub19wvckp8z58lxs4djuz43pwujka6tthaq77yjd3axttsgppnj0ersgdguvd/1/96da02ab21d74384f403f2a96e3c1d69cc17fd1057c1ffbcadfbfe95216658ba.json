Tokenomyopia\nThe disease of short-term vision.\nSymptoms: Staring at charts while forgetting the product is still “in development.”\n\n2. Shillucination\nA trance-like state induced by 12 influencers saying “This is the one.”\n\n3. DAOpathy\nWhen your DAO has 30,000 members but 6 votes on the latest proposal.\n\n4. Rugtensity\nThat gnawing sense you're about to get ruggged… but the mint is live now so you do it anyway.\n\n5. Mintoxication\nThe euphoric high of minting.\nOften followed by regret and hiding the transaction from your spouse.\n\n6. DeFriction\nThe magical experience of needing 5 apps, 3 wallets, and $42 in gas to move $7 of USDC.\n\n7. Ethernesia\nThe act of opening MetaMask, forgetting why, then closing it again 5 popups later.\n\n8. Nostrageous\nThat Bitcoiner energy on every decentralized protocol.\nDefault setting: Smug.\n\n9. Ponzinometry\nThe fine art of convincing yourself you're early to the next big thing.\n\n10. Whitepaperweight\nThat 62-page unread whitepaper on your desktop.\nMakes you feel important. You will never open it.\n\n11. FUDgeability\nHow fast your conviction melts when the chart dips 12%.\n(“I always knew this was a scam…”)\n\n12. Chainalgia\nNostalgia for the good old days when gas was 2 gwei and ETH was $12.\n\n13. Proof-of-Vibes\nThe real consensus model behind 90% of NFT projects.\nIf the Discord is vibin', the mint must be solid.\n\n14. Zapathy\nThe moment you stop appreciating Lightning zaps because it’s “just 21 sats.”\n\n15. Webthreft\nThat hollow feeling when a dApp eats your ETH and gives you a JPEG with no roadmap.\n\nIf you've ever experienced more than 3 of these symptoms...\nyou may be entitled to compensation.\n(jk it's all gone, check the wallet.)\n\nWhich one's your favorite?\nAdd your own sniglet below ⬇️\nAnd if you laughed, zap me some sats ⚡🧡\n\nP.S. This satire was co-written with ChatGPT—because even my AI is tired of Web3's vibes-based economy.\n\n#Web3 #Bitcoin #CryptoCulture #Sniglets #ProofOfVibes #Mintoxication #Rugtensity #BitcoinHumor #Nostr #Primal",
