Exactly 3 Weeks on Nostr 🧭

Exactly three weeks ago today I joined Nostr (joined May 4) and I started posting in earnest here. I didn’t know exactly what I was building — I just knew I was done waiting for permission.

In that time:
	•	✅ Verified with Primal Premium
	•	✍️ Completed a 5-part series: Why I Left Web3 for Proof of Work
	•	🛠️ Pushed my first public GitHub repo (Nostr signal tools)
	•	⚡ Posted daily (with signal > noise)
	•	💰 Received 2,851 sats in zaps
	•	🌐 Discovered GitHub Pages & self-hosting
	•	🧱 Got the spark for Continuum, my social data sovereignty project
	•	🎂 Turned 60
	•	🤖 Got a huge boost from ChatGPT for writing, formatting, and ideation

It’s been a blur of building, pruning, and rediscovering purpose — with Bitcoin, with faith, with story. I’m not here to go viral. I’m here to leave a mark that lasts.

To those who’ve read, zapped, followed, replied — thank you.
To those still lurking — your time will come.

This is only the beginning.
This is why I’m here.
This is Proof of Work.

🙏
