# Just shipped my first sovereign gated article through Continuum → Primal.

Andrew G. Stanton - August 24, 2025

Just shipped my first *sovereign gated article* with Continuum → Primal.

Flow:

- Public teaser (free)
- Zap (500 sats)
- Full article delivered via encrypted DM
- Backup: the complete Markdown archived in my own encrypted inbox

⚡️ No Substack. No Patreon. No PayPal. Just sats → content.

**Note for Pro users & Patrons of Continuum**:

This feature is being built into Continuum Pro. That means:

- You’ll be able to write your own gated articles or notes directly inside Continuum.
- Post a free teaser to Nostr.
- Set a sats unlock price.
- When a supporter zaps you, Continuum will handle the flow → deliver the full piece as an encrypted DM, with the option to archive every article automatically.

It’s a sovereign monetization path: no platforms, no middlemen, just your keys, your npub, and your audience.
