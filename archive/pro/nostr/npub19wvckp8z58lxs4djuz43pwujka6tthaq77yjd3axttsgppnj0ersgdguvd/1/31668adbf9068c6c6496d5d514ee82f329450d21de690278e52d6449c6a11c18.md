🧡 Why I Post Here

I don’t post on Nostr for money, likes, or clout.
I post because I believe in Bitcoin, in truth, and in building things that last.

You won’t find gimmicks here.
No clickbait. No hype. Just thoughts, questions, and signals from the frontlines of faith, freedom, and proof-of-work.

That said — if something I write helps you see more clearly, think more deeply, or live more freely…

Feel free to zap.
Every sat goes back into stacking, building, or supporting others doing the same.

We’re not here to go viral.
We’re here to build the next economy.
