  "content": "7 Days of Hawai‘i, Bitcoin, and Freedom\n\n🌋 Why Hawai‘i? Why Bitcoin? Why now?\n\nI wasn’t born in Hawai‘i — I was born in Palau.  But my youngest sister and brother were born in Hawai‘i, and that land has marked my spirit in a lasting way.\n\nHawai‘i is more than paradise. It’s a place of beauty, betrayal, and longing for restoration. The overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom wasn’t just political — it was spiritual.\n\nOver the next 7 days, I’ll be reflecting on sovereignty through the lens of Hawai‘i — and how Bitcoin reawakens the deeper questions of land, truth, and independence.\n\nThis is not a political series. It’s a series about proof of work, dignity, and aloha.\n\nI call it Akamai Sovereignty.\n\nOne post a day. From the ʻāina to the blockchain. From injustice to redemption.\n\nIf this resonates, follow.\n\nDay 1 drops tomorrow. 🌱\n\n#Bitcoin #AlohaAina #Sovereignty #Decentralization #ProofOfWork #HawaiiHistory #AkamaiSovereignty",
