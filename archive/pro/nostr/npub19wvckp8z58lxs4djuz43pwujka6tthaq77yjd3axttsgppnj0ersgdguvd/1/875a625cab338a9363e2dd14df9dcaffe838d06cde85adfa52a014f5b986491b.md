🧭 Three Ventures, One Philosophy

I’ve been thinking a lot about how to align my work with what I believe — not just spiritually, but economically and technologically.

Proof of work, not proof of marketing.

Right now, I’m stewarding three ventures:

🏛 Golden Gate Group Investments
This is where I hold several Texas properties. It’s more than an LLC — it’s a seed for something bigger.
I want this to become a Bitcoin-first real estate venture. Rents in BTC. Property purchases on-chain. Long-term, sovereign ownership — grounded in trust and time preference.

🌍 Blue Planet Ventures
Right now, it’s still new — but it represents my intent to explore the intersection of capital, responsibility, and long-term sustainability.
This could evolve into a fund or studio focused on high-integrity trading, Bitcoin-aligned impact models, or regenerative finance powered by proof of work.
A place to take risks — not for hype, but for stewardship.

🤖 StartNation
Co-founded with Kevin, who sees it as an AI-centric engine for empowering startups. I share that vision.
We help early-stage ventures grow by trading equity for talent, not VC capital.
While Bitcoin isn’t woven into StartNation’s mission today, the deeper philosophy — skin in the game, long-term value, sustainability — still resonates with everything I believe.

Not every venture I touch will scream “Bitcoin” from the outside.
But inside — at the level of conviction, ethics, and vision — I know what anchors me.

Proof of Work isn’t just a protocol.
It’s a way of showing up.
