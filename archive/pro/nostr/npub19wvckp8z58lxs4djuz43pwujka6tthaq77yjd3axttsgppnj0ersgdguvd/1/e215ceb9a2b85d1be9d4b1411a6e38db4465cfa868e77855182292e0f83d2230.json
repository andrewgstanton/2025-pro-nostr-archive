But it should be.\n\nThink of it as a Sniglet — a made-up word that should exist, like those gems from the classic SNL skits.\n\nthought-leadery /thôt-ˈlēd-ər-ē/\nadj.\nResembling or characteristic of a thought leader, especially in a way that’s overly polished, vague, or heavy on buzzwords and light on substance.\n\nUsage:\n“That post was so thought-leadery I almost booked a breakthrough branding call.”\n\nExamples:\n– “Let’s co-create value in the authenticity space.”\n– “Thoughts below 👇”\n– “I help 7-figure founders unlock their scalable story.”\n\n🔎 You know it when you see it.\n\nI’m not here for that.\nI’m here for conviction > performance, clarity > charisma, and building with proof of work.\n\n⚠️ And if I ever come across like that in any of my posts — please, I beg you:\n\nSHOUT AT ME: “HYPOCRITE! YOU’RE DOING THE SAME THING BRO!”\n\nWe don’t need more thought leaders.\nWe need more real builders who show up, quietly and consistently.\n\n⚡️ Zap me if you’re allergic to empty buzzwords too\n🤖 Written with the help of ChatGPT, who’s never once tried to pitch me brand coaching\n\n#ThoughtLeadery #Sniglets #ProofOfWork #BuildDontPerform #StillBuilding #CallMeOut",
