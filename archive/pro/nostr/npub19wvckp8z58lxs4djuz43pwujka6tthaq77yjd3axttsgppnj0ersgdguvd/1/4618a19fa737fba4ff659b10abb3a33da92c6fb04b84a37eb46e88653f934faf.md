Grateful for those early zaps—thank you 🙏

My zap icon isn’t active yet (still using Strike to receive sats), but it works.

If anything I’ve posted—on faith, Bitcoin, or mission-driven building—has encouraged or resonated with you, feel free to zap ⚡

I’m the CTO at StartNation and actively exploring how Bitcoin can support missions  in places like India and Africa.

Building on Bitcoin. Rooted in the Victorious Gospel.
