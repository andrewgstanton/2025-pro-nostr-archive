I went through some of the same questions first few days of using nostr, hope I can help , this was the easiest way for me:

1. download the mobile app for nostr, login using your private key

2. enable the wallet in the mobile app. (settings -> wallet -> start in wallet)
(it will automatically give you a lightning address that updates your profile (mine is wittmoth13@primal.net)

 3. In your web application primal (log in using your private key), connect the primal wallet (settings -> connected wallets -> Connect).  Mine is enabled, but I showed the screen as you would see it, screenshot below:

4. One it's connected you should be able to receive and send sats
(once you have zap enabled, let me know I will zap you some)
