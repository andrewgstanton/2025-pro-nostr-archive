  "content": "Why spend Bitcoin if it’s going up in value?\n\nBecause freedom isn’t just stored — it’s lived.\n\nYes, HODLing is powerful. It’s defiance against inflation. A long bet on a better system.\nBut if everyone only holds and never spends, Bitcoin risks becoming just another trophy asset — admired, but unused.\n\nValue isn’t realized only when sold.\nIt’s realized when you trade freely — without permission, friction, or surveillance.\n\nSpending Bitcoin today doesn’t mean giving up gains.\nIt means supporting the merchants and builders who make a Bitcoin economy real.\nIt means bootstrapping the world we want — one sat at a time.\n\nAnd here’s the deeper truth:\nIf Bitcoin works like we believe it does, then what you give in sats now will come back around — multiplied by the circular economy you’re helping to ignite.\n\nStack. Yes.\nBut also spend.\nNot recklessly — but intentionally.\nUse Lightning. Tip. Pay a friend. Buy from sovereign businesses.\n\nFreedom is not just a number on a screen.\nIt’s a way of life.\n\n— Andrew\nnpub19wvck… | zap: https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t\n\n#Bitcoin #HODLAndSpend #SpendBitcoin #CircularEconomy #SovereignMoney #ProofOfWork #ZapLife #GreshamsLaw #FreedomTech #OptOut #BuildTheNew",
