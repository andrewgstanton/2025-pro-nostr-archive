Closing on Pizza Day

Been writing a lot lately — not for clicks, but to process, reflect, and share what’s been stirring in me.
The response so far has been deeply encouraging. A few sats here and there might not seem like much, but to me, every zap is a signal: “I see you. Keep going.”

I’m this close to hitting 1,000 sats by Bitcoin Pizza Day — just 90 to go.
If something I’ve written has resonated, feel free to zap and help me cross that line.

Not begging — just stacking. 🍕
