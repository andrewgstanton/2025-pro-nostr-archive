It’s as if grace itself vibrates through the network, echoing from soul to soul.\n\nnostr:nprofile1qqsr26r4lltjnvrwadxp67ns58m4qpzaqemhf5sup7hlujhjh7t296qpr3mhxue69uhkummnw3ezucnfw33k76twv4ezuum0vd5kzmqppamhxue69uhkumewwd68ytnrwg5pml9e 500-sat zap (thank you sir!) the quiet “Onward 👆” from nostr:nprofile1qqsr37dqts0p3qzpp2yegvn03ujyt6hj97djkmqn6tcfrrvedxvlcpqpramhxue69uhkummnw3ez6vpj9ejx7unpveskxar0wfujummjvuhsz8nhwden5te0dehhxarj94c82c3wwajkcmr0wfjx2u3wdejhgtcl28a8f —these weren’t transactions. They were acknowledgments of the same pull. Even those who see theology differently can feel when the center holds.\n\nI keep thinking about that: how love exerts gravity.\n\nWe orbit it, resist it, misread it—but we cannot escape it.\n\nCalvinists call it sovereignty. Mystics call it union. \n\nPhysicists call it attraction.\n\nI just call it Christ.\n\nHis holiness isn’t a static throne above us—it’s the living core within all things, drawing every fragment back into coherence. \n\nJudgment is not just His anger (sometimes it is) but His weight—the pressure of truth collapsing pride into light.\n\nSo yes, onward indeed.\nEvery debate, every difference, every small spark of understanding—these are just eddies in the larger current. \n\nThe gravity of grace is doing what it always does: pulling everything home.\n\n“And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Myself.” — John 12:32\n\n#VictoriousGospel #GraceGravity #Onward\n\nThank you all for the conversation and the encouragement!!",
