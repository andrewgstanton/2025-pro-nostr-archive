Not All “Emerging Tech” Is Created Equal

AI and Bitcoin are going to shape the future in deep, irreversible ways.
They’re not just tools—they’re forces that reshape how we work, think, and exchange value.

But let’s be honest:

“Metaverse.”
“Crypto.”
“Blockchain.”

These words get tossed around like they’re world-changing innovations.
But too often, they’re just empty jargon—designed to sound smart while masking a lack of substance.

I’m not saying there’s zero value in all these projects.
But there’s a difference between noise and signal.
Between narratives built to raise capital…
and systems built to withstand reality.

AI is real.
Bitcoin is real.
Proof of Work is real.

The rest?
Time will tell.
But I’m choosing to build where the foundation holds.
