- Today (Aug 20) I published four pieces:

1) Odd at Home in the Open Field — why Nostr’s open fields let “odd” finally breathe.
2) Part 1: The Problem Stated — “All” vs “Eternal” (Victorious Gospel series).
3) Toward a Sharper Definition of Sovereign Technology — tightening the terms.
4) White Paper: Sovereign Storage — foundations + rationale.
