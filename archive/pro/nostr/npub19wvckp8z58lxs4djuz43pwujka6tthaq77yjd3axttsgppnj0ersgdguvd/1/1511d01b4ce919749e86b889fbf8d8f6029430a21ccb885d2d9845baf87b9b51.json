  "content": "TURNING THE WALLED GARDEN INTO AN OASIS\n\nStarted the process for importing data from my LinkedIn account.\n\nI’ve started working with ChatGPT to categorize my LinkedIn posts, articles, and profile — mapping them to Nostr event types (1, 30023, and 0 respectively).\n\nEventually I want to create posts and articles here and have them automatically crossposted to LinkedIn — using my npub identity that’s linked to my LinkedIn profile.\n\nI’m publishing outside the walled garden — but creating a two-way bridge to LinkedIn, allowing both import and export of content.\n\nFor all practical purposes, LinkedIn becomes just another relay — a lens through which my content is viewed, not the source. Walled gardens can be peaceful places to visit, a break from the noisy street — but they lose their value when you’re not free to leave. I’d rather treat LinkedIn as an oasis: a spot to reflect, not a place to live.\n\n#linkedin #nostr #data-sovereignty #continuum #continuum-pro\n",
