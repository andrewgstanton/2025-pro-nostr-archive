Reconciling the Tension

There’s a tension I live with — between the high-frequency pace of day trading equities and the low-time-preference ethos of Bitcoin.
One rewards split-second decisions. The other invites long-term conviction.
One feels like noise. The other, signal.

But I’ve come to see my work — trading, coding, mentoring — not as contradiction, but convergence.
Each is a form of stewardship. Each is a way to sharpen focus, create value, and — over time — convert fleeting gains into something enduring: Bitcoin.
Not for hoarding. But for freedom.

“Owe no one anything, except to love each other.” (Romans 13:8)
“It is for freedom that Christ has set us free…” (Galatians 5:1)

I’m tired of debt — the financial kind, but also the spiritual weight of scarcity.
I want to live and build from a place of overflow, not just endurance.
To be free enough to let what I do — all of it — bless others without strings attached.

Still, the tension doesn’t disappear. It keeps me grounded. It reminds me I’m not finished yet.
And maybe that’s the point —
To hold the tension long enough
for something beautiful to grow from it.
