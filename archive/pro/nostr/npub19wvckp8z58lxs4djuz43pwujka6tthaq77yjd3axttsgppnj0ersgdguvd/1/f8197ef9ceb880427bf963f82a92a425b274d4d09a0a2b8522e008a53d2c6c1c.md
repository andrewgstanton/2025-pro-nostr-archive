What Is Vibe Coding? (At Least the Way I See It)

People throw around the term vibe coding like it’s just shipping fast with a meme and a mood. But for me, it’s something deeper — and a lot more intentional.

Yes, I move fast. Yes, I use AI tools like ChatGPT to amplify output. Yes, I try to ship without waiting for permission.

But when I build — whether it’s a GitHub repo, a post series, or a sovereign stack — I’m not chasing dopamine or trying to be clever. I’m building from conviction.

For me, vibe coding means:
	•	Coding in alignment with values.
I build with Bitcoin as my base layer, faith as my foundation, and truth as my compass.
	•	Coding with narrative.
Every tool I release — from Nostr signal filters to Continuum — carries a story. Not just what it does, but why it matters.
	•	Coding for people, not platforms.
I’m not here to feed engagement metrics. I’m here to connect with other builders, thinkers, and seekers who want to make something real.
	•	Coding in public.
The act of sharing — raw, unfinished, unpolished — is part of the work. You can’t build trust in silence.

Earlier this month, I turned 60. I’m just getting started.
You don’t need to be 25 in SF with an AI startup to build with purpose — and you don’t need to wait for someone to hand you a microphone.

Whether you’re 15 or 50, it’s never too early or too late to make your voice heard.
Never too late to build what matters.
Never too late to ship something honest.

This is Proof of Work, not Proof of Performance.
This is how I build now.
This is vibe coding.
