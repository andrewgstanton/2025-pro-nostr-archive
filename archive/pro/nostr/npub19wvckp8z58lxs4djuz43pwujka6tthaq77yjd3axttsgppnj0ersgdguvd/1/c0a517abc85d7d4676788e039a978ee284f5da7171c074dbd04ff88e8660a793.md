Why does a $1,200 phone not come with a charger?

Just got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Beautiful hardware — but once again, no charging brick included. Just a USB-C to USB-C cable (male to male). If you don’t already have a compatible charger, you’re stuck buying one separately.

Apple calls it “environmental.” I call it upselling.
