# 🚀 Continuum v1.4 milestone

🚀 Continuum v1.4 milestone:

I just imported my LinkedIn profile — and published it as a sovereign Nostr identity (complete with kind:0 metadata).

No OAuth. No scraping. No API keys. Just exported ZIP → parsed JSON → signed + published.

One identity. Many contexts. Fully portable.
