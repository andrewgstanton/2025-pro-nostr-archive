🏃‍♂️ Bay to Breakers 2025 — San Francisco’s annual parade of chaos and joy.



I ran this race years ago with my wife — and my dad. Around 2008, we joined the stream of costumed strangers crossing the city from Bay to breakers, laughing through the madness.

Somewhere between the pink gorillas and rolling kegs, it stopped being just a race. It became a memory. A tradition. A thread in the fabric of my SF story.

Watching it unfold again today, I’m reminded:
This city still pulses with life. You just have to keep moving with it.
