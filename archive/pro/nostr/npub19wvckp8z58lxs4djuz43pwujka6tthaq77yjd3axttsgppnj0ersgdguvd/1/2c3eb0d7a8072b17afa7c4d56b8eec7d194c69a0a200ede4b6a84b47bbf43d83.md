There’s a paradox at the heart of value creation:

If you chase money, it often slips away. But if you show up to serve — to speak truth, solve real problems, or share a story that needs telling — value has a way of finding you.

I’m not here to monetize. I’m here because I can’t not build, write, and reflect. There’s friction I feel. There’s clarity I want to offer. And somehow, when that’s my posture, the support shows up — zaps, encouragement, connection.

“Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.”
— Proverbs 22:29

“He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough!”
— Proverbs 28:19 (NKJV)
“Those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty.” — Proverbs 28:19 (paraphrased)

Quiet faithfulness creates lasting fruit. Chasing shortcuts usually ends in shadows.

So I’ll keep showing up for the signal. The rest is in God’s hands.

⚡️If this resonates, zap away. It helps me keep doing the work.
