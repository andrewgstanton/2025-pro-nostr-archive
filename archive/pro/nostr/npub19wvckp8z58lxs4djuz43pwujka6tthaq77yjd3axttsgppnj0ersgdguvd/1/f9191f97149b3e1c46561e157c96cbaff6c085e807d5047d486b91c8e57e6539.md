Would the Amish Use Bitcoin?

It’s a strange question at first glance.

The Amish—known for rejecting modern technology—don’t chase trends, don’t use electricity freely, and certainly don’t tweet about macro cycles or halving charts.

But maybe that’s exactly why the question matters.

Because Bitcoin isn’t modern in the way most tech is.
It doesn’t promise convenience.
It doesn’t scale via dopamine.
It doesn’t optimize for speed.

Bitcoin is slow, intentional, costly.
It’s rooted in proof. It resists inflation. It rewards work and punishes haste.
It doesn’t require trust in man—only math, energy, and time.

That sounds more Amish than Silicon Valley.

The Amish don’t reject technology outright—they reject tech that disrupts their values. If a tool harms the family, the community, or the soul, it’s out. But if it supports self-sovereignty, durability, and truth, they might quietly adopt it—even if only at the margins.

So would the Amish use Bitcoin?

Maybe not openly. Maybe not digitally.
But they might accept it for what it is:

🪙 Honest money.
🛠 Proof of work.
🌾 A return to cost, effort, and truth.

And maybe that’s a question we all need to ask:

Is this technology aligned with my values? Or does it hollow them out?

⚠️ Disclaimer: I’ve never visited an Amish community—though I admire their conviction in many ways. The closest I’ve come was seeing a Mennonite couple in traditional dress strolling peacefully through the chaos of Waikiki years ago. The contrast struck me then—and still does.

🟠 Bitcoin doesn’t demand attention—it earns trust.

If that sounds more like tradition than tech, maybe we’re finally asking better questions.

Zap or reply if this sparked something.
I’d love to hear your take—even if you’re not Amish 😉
