⚡️Is it a sat or a bitcoin?
Some want to call 1 satoshi “1 bitcoin” — redefining the unit so 1 BTC = 100,000,000 bitcoins.

I get the logic. But for most people, it just adds confusion.

I like "sat."
It’s short, simple, and keeps the mental model intact.
More importantly — I don’t think this debate matters as much as some believe.

What matters is getting people to use Bitcoin. To understand it. To experience it.

In the interest of not ruffling any feathers, I’ll just say:
Zap me some sats/bitcoin if this resonates ⚡️🙂
