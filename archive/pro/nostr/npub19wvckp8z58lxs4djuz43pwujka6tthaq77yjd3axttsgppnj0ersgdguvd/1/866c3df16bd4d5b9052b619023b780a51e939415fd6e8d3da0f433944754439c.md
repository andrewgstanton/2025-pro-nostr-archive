So apparently, being a principled Bitcoin maxi means I’m:

✅ Mean-spirited
✅ Narrow-minded
✅ Anti-innovation
✅ Some kind of right-wing goldbug survivalist
✅ Probably a bigot with a vendetta against unicorns and good vibes

At least, that’s the caricature.

Because obviously, if I’m not excited about minting 47 million governance tokens to fund a DAO that pays influencers to raise awareness about a metaverse charity with no working product — I must hate progress.

And if I don’t think it’s a great idea to tokenize carbon offsets using a new ERC-42069 token standard approved by the Web3 Foundation and verified on-chain by five anonymous Discord mods…
…it’s because I’m clearly anti-science and anti-planet.

I get it.

I mean, how dare I believe money should be hard, permissionless, and settled in finality without an “oracle” or “multi-sig council” somewhere in Silicon Valley?

How dare I want property rights without middlemen, scarcity without marketing teams, and freedom without an app update.

No, I don’t want to “bridge to Solana.”
No, I don’t want to stake in your layer-zero, infinite-scaling timechain that’s “like Bitcoin, but better.”
And no, I’m not early to this new opportunity — I’m just not interested in being your exit liquidity.

Here’s what I am interested in:
	•	Open protocols with no centralized kill switch
	•	Sound money with no foundation attached
	•	Communities that don’t require a presale to participate
	•	Work that proves value — not vibes

Bitcoin is boring. It’s slow. It’s misunderstood.
And it doesn’t need me to evangelize it — it just keeps producing blocks every 10 minutes, whether I post or not.

But I speak up anyway — not because I’m closed-minded or toxic — but because I’ve seen this story before.
I bought the tokens. I joined the Discords. I believed the mission statements.
And I watched as “community” turned into “marketing,” “equity” into “exit,” and “decentralization” into just another cap table.

So if you want to call me a maxi, go for it.
But I’d rather be principled than programmable.
I’d rather be boring than bought.
And I’d rather tell you the truth than sell you a dream.

Bitcoin isn’t everything. But it’s the foundation.
And I’m done apologizing for standing on rock while the rest of the house sinks.

Oh — and in case you’re wondering how much of a Luddite I really am?
I enlisted the help of Dr. C (ChatGPT) to craft this post.
Because nothing says “anti-tech maximalist” like collaborating with an AI to dunk on altcoins.
