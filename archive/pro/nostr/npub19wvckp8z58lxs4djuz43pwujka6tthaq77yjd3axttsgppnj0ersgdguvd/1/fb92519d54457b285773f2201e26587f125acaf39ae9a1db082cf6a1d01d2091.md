Helping with NIP-05 Verification

I sometimes set up NIP-05 addresses under mycontinuum.xyz as a convenience for those who don’t have their own domain or don’t want to deal with the technical setup right away.

To be clear: this never involves your private key. NIP-05 is only a text file that links your npub to a domain. Using my domain is optional, and you can always move your NIP-05 to your own domain or another service at any time.

My goal is simple: help people get verified and sovereign, not dependent.
