7 Days of Hawai‘i, Bitcoin, and Freedom

🌋 Why Hawai‘i? Why Bitcoin? Why now?

I wasn’t born in Hawai‘i — I was born in Palau.  But my youngest sister and brother were born in Hawai‘i, and that land has marked my spirit in a lasting way.

Hawai‘i is more than paradise. It’s a place of beauty, betrayal, and longing for restoration. The overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom wasn’t just political — it was spiritual.

Over the next 7 days, I’ll be reflecting on sovereignty through the lens of Hawai‘i — and how Bitcoin reawakens the deeper questions of land, truth, and independence.

This is not a political series. It’s a series about proof of work, dignity, and aloha.

I call it Akamai Sovereignty.

One post a day. From the ʻāina to the blockchain. From injustice to redemption.

If this resonates, follow.

Day 1 drops tomorrow. 🌱
