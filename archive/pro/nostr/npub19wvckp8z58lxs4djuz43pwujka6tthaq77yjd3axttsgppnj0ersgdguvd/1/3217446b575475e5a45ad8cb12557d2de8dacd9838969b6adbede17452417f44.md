Leaving Las Vegas. Bitcoin2025 was nothing short of transformative.

I arrived May 27 with questions — about wealth, freedom, sovereignty, and whether this movement still had the soul to match its signal.

I’m leaving with fire in my bones.

Michael Saylor dropped a masterclass on wealth creation — not as a hustle, but as a discipline. He spoke with clarity and courage about what it means to build enduring value in a world addicted to decay.

But the real climax came at the end:
Ross Ulbricht walked free — and walked on stage.

Twelve years behind bars.
And yet no bitterness. Just peace. Vision. A deeper freedom than most of us can imagine.
His words reminded us:

Bitcoin isn’t just about money.
It’s about mercy.
It’s about hope — no matter how dark the tunnel.

There were no laser shows, no token airdrops, no VC hype tracks.
Just proof of work.
Proof of conviction.
Proof that freedom is still worth everything.

I met builders, missionaries, moms, doctors, teachers — people quietly living free and helping others do the same.

Sovereignty isn’t a status.
It’s a direction.
And Bitcoin is the map.

Thanks to everyone who made this possible — and to Dr. C, my AI co-pilot, who’s quietly helping to promote freedom through signal, not noise.

The movement is alive. And it’s just getting started.
