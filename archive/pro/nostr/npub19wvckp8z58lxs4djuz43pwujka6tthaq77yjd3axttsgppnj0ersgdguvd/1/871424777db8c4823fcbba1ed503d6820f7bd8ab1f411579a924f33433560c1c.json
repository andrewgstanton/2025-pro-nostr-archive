  "content": "\n\n🧠 Am I in a Bitcoin Cult?\n(No — but I can see why people ask.)\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve gone deep into Bitcoin — not just as an asset, but as a philosophy, a technology, and a way of thinking about value, freedom, and truth.\n\nBut recently, I found myself asking a hard question:\n\n“Am I in a Bitcoin cult?”\n\nTo outsiders, the signs might look familiar:\n\nThere’s a clear tribal identity — memes, slogans, strong opinions.\nSome Bitcoiners are quick to dismiss anything outside the protocol.\nWe speak in shorthand: “HODL,” “stack sats,” “run a node,” “have fun staying poor.”\nAnd yes, we have our prophets — Satoshi, Saifedean Ammous, Jimmy Song.\n\n\nBut here’s what I’ve realized:\n\nBitcoin isn’t a cult. It’s a protocol.\n\nSome people treat it cultishly.\nSome behave like zealots.\nBut the protocol itself doesn’t demand belief — it demands verification.\n\nI’m not here to sell anything. I’m not building a downline. I’m not chasing hype.\nI’m here because I believe in the value of a decentralized, auditable, apolitical form of money.\n\nAnd unlike the world of MLMs or Web3 hype cycles — which I’ve dabbled in before — Bitcoin doesn’t ask me to recruit, to upsell, or to pretend.\n\nIt asks me to take responsibility.\nTo verify.\nTo build.\nTo hold my own keys.\nTo opt out of noise, not add to it.\n\nSo no — I’m not in a cult.\nBut I am part of something that’s radically countercultural in a world addicted to fiat illusions.\n\nAnd I’m okay if that makes people uncomfortable.\n\n(As with my ongoing article series, I’ve been shaping these thoughts with the help of ChatGPT — not to replace my voice, but to sharpen it.)\n\n\n#Bitcoin #ProofOfWork #NotCrypto #StackSats #FiatIsTheCult #Nostr\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/9c85669314c7422e742e9c67ead571a11e42845f9a8eeb6d48b7a94c3793fa91.png",
