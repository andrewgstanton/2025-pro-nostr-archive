  "content": "Why does a $1,200 phone not come with a charger?\n\nJust got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Beautiful hardware — but once again, no charging brick included.

If you don’t already have a compatible charger, you’re stuck buying one separately.\n\nApple calls it “environmental.” I call it upselling.\n\n#iPhone16 #Apple #USB-C #ChargingBrickNotIncluded #TechAnnoyances",
