# Christmas Eve (Dec. 24, 2025) - Reflection V — Toward the Stars, Not Away From Earth

When I write about humanity going toward the stars, I don’t mean running away.

I mean carrying memory, law, and responsibility farther than before — without pretending we’ve outgrown them.

Christmas reminds us that meaning doesn’t scale by force.
It scales by fidelity.


That’s the kind of future I’m trying to imagine.


_This reflection is part of a long-form project called Bitcoin Chronicles, published gradually and intentionally._

Peace to you tonight.

(meant to post this Christmas Eve, but it looks like I missed this last one)
