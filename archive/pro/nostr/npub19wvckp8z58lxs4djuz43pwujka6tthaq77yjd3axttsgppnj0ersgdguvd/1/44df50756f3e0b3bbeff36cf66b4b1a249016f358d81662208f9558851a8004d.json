  "content": "# The Fiat Trash Culture Teaser (Oct. 22, 2025)\n\nEverything seems more expensive because it is — and not just in price.  \n\nThe fiat world exacts a tax on *integrity.*\n\n> “When money is created from nothing, everything built on it inherits the same cheapness.”  \n> “Fiat time produces fiat art: instantly gratifying, instantly forgotten.”  \n> “Sound money is sound mind. Fiat is landfill. Bitcoin is the compost that grows the next civilization.”\n\nThis new **paid Continuum essay** digs into the aesthetic, moral, and economic rot of fiat culture — and why Bitcoin represents a rebirth of craftsmanship and truth.\n\n🪙 **Read the full essay:** *The Fiat Trash Culture* (1500 words) — zap 500 sats to unlock. \n\nhttps://primal.net/andrewgstanton\n \n📅 Published: **October 22, 2025**",
