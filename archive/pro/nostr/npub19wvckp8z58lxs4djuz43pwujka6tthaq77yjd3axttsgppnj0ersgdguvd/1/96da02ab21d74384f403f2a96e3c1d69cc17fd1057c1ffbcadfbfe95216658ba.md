🧠 Web3 Has Broken My Brain (A Sniglet Thread)

I've been in Web3 long enough to know... we need new words.
Here are 15 made-up terms for things only crypto folks understand👇

1. Tokenomyopia
The disease of short-term vision.
Symptoms: Staring at charts while forgetting the product is still “in development.”

2. Shillucination
A trance-like state induced by 12 influencers saying “This is the one.”

3. DAOpathy
When your DAO has 30,000 members but 6 votes on the latest proposal.

4. Rugtensity
That gnawing sense you're about to get ruggged… but the mint is live now so you do it anyway.

5. Mintoxication
The euphoric high of minting.
Often followed by regret and hiding the transaction from your spouse.

6. DeFriction
The magical experience of needing 5 apps, 3 wallets, and $42 in gas to move $7 of USDC.

7. Ethernesia
The act of opening MetaMask, forgetting why, then closing it again 5 popups later.

8. Nostrageous
That Bitcoiner energy on every decentralized protocol.
Default setting: Smug.

9. Ponzinometry
The fine art of convincing yourself you're early to the next big thing.

10. Whitepaperweight
That 62-page unread whitepaper on your desktop.
Makes you feel important. You will never open it.

11. FUDgeability
How fast your conviction melts when the chart dips 12%.
(“I always knew this was a scam…”)

12. Chainalgia
Nostalgia for the good old days when gas was 2 gwei and ETH was $12.

13. Proof-of-Vibes
The real consensus model behind 90% of NFT projects.
If the Discord is vibin', the mint must be solid.

14. Zapathy
The moment you stop appreciating Lightning zaps because it’s “just 21 sats.”

15. Webthreft
That hollow feeling when a dApp eats your ETH and gives you a JPEG with no roadmap.

If you've ever experienced more than 3 of these symptoms...
you may be entitled to compensation.
(jk it's all gone, check the wallet.)

P.S. This satire was co-written with ChatGPT—because even my AI is tired of Web3's vibes-based economy.
