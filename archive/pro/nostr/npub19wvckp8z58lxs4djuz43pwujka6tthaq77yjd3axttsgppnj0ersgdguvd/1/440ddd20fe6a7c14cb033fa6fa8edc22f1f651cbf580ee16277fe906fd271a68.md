🚀 Just published a new repo!

I wanted to see how quickly I could spin up a self-contained, Dockerized app that demos:

✅ User signup
✅ Login
✅ Email verification

It’s all built in Python/Flask and fully containerized — a quick, clean demo you can run locally.

Check it out here:

Let me know what you think — happy to improve or extend it further.
