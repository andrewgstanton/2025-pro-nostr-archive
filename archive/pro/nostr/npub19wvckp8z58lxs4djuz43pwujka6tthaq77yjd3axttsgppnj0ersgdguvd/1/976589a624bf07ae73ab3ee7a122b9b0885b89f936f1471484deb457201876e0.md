Most people think Nostr is “local-first” because they control their keys.

Key custody ≠ local-first.

For most users, identity, memory, and continuity still live in apps and relays they don’t control.

Local-first means your machine is the source of truth — apps and relays are just views and distribution.

That part of Nostr is still unfinished.
