Happy Father’s Day to the men who reflect the heart of our Father in heaven.
Not perfectly, but faithfully.
With kindness. With strength. With the courage to love when it costs something.

Whether you’re a dad, a mentor, a spiritual father, or walking with a father’s heart—thank you.

You are seen. You are needed.
Your work echoes into eternity.
