  "content": "Reconciling the Tension\n\nThere’s a tension I live with — between the high-frequency pace of day trading equities and the low-time-preference ethos of Bitcoin.\nOne rewards split-second decisions. The other invites long-term conviction.\nOne feels like noise. The other, signal.\n\nBut I’ve come to see my work — trading, coding, mentoring — not as contradiction, but convergence.\nEach is a form of stewardship. Each is a way to sharpen focus, create value, and — over time — convert fleeting gains into something enduring: Bitcoin.\nNot for hoarding. But for freedom.\n\n“Owe no one anything, except to love each other.” (Romans 13:8)\n“It is for freedom that Christ has set us free…” (Galatians 5:1)\n\nI’m tired of debt — the financial kind, but also the spiritual weight of scarcity.\nI want to live and build from a place of overflow, not just endurance.\nTo be free enough to let what I do — all of it — bless others without strings attached.\n\nStill, the tension doesn’t disappear. It keeps me grounded. It reminds me I’m not finished yet.\nAnd maybe that’s the point —\nTo hold the tension long enough\nfor something beautiful to grow from it.\n\nWritten with the help of ChatGPT — proofread, prayed over, and posted with purpose.\nIf this resonates, feel free to zap ⚡️\n\n#bitcoin #proofOfWork #trading #freedom #faith #nostr #lowtimepreference #buildwithconviction #zapworthy #chatgpt",
