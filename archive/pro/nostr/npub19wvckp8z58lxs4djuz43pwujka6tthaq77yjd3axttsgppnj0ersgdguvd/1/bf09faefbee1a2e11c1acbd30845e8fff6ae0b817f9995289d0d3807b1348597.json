A thoughtfully made device. A system that just works without shouting for attention.\nIt’s like art. There’s elegance in simplicity. Grace in good engineering.\n\nBut I don’t love tech for its own sake.\nI’m not here to worship speed, scale, or novelty.\n\nI want technology that makes human life richer—not just faster.\nTechnology that serves people, not platforms.\nThat supports honesty, clarity, and craft, not noise and manipulation.\n\nThat’s a hard line to walk—especially now.\n\nBecause the incentives push the other way.\nToward hype. Growth-at-all-costs. Optimization without meaning.\nIt’s easy to lose the plot in a world where tools are praised more than the lives they shape.\n\nBut I keep coming back to this:\n\n⚒️ I want to build things that reflect what I value.\n🛠️ I want to use tools that help people become more human—not less.\n📖 I want to tell stories that are true, even when they’re not trending.\n🤲 I want to give without expecting anything in return—because that’s where real value starts.\n✝️ And above all, I’m compelled by The Victorious Gospel—by the irresistible love of God that seeks and saves, restores and renews.\n\nThat’s what drives me. That’s why I keep showing up.\n\nYes, I use ChatGPT. I write code. I trade. I experiment with AI and open protocols.\nBut I try to stay grounded. To ask not just “what can we build?”—but “what should we build?”\n\nIf you feel this tension too—the pull between wonder and wisdom, between progress and principles—you’re not alone.\n\n🟠 Zap or reply. Let’s talk about what it means to be a principled builder in a noisy world.\n\nhttps://primal.net/andrewgstanton\n\n#PrincipledBuilder #FaithAndTech #VictoriousGospel #IrresistibleGrace #TechWithPurpose #HumanCenteredTech #DigitalDiscipleship #LowTimePreference #BuildWithConviction #ProofOfWork #Craftsmanship #GospelDriven #SimplicityInTech #SlowTech #ZapLife #Nostr #BitcoinMindset #GiveFreely #GraceInAction #TruthOverTrends",
