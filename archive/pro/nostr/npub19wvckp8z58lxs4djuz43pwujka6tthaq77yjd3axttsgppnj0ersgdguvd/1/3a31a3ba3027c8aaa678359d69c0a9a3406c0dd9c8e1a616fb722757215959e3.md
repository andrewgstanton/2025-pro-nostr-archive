I don’t believe Israelis and Palestinians truly hate each other.

I’ve heard the narratives. I’ve seen the headlines. I know the history is complex and painful.
But hate? I don’t buy it — not as the default of the human heart.

Most people don’t want war. They want to live.
To love, raise families, worship in peace, and build a future.

The truth is: most ordinary Israelis and Palestinians do not inherently hate each other.
What they often feel is fear, grief, and exhaustion — emotions stoked by generations of trauma, political manipulation, and systems that benefit from division.

Here’s some perspective:
	•	Hatred is rarely organic. It’s taught, inflamed, and reinforced — by media, by leaders, by violent events, and by lack of human contact.
	•	Many Israelis grow up under the shadow of rockets and suicide bombings, taught that Palestinians want to destroy them.
	•	Many Palestinians grow up under occupation, restricted movement, and military presence, taught that Israelis are oppressors.

And yet — in moments where people meet, really meet — many discover shared humanity:
	•	Israeli and Palestinian doctors work side by side in hospitals.
	•	Joint tech startups and peace groups exist — often quietly — bringing people together.
	•	Parents who’ve lost children on both sides have formed groups like the Parents Circle-Families Forum, choosing reconciliation over revenge.

What we see most often, though, are the extremists — because extremes grab headlines and reinforce the narrative that peace is impossible.

But the quieter truth is this: most people just want to live.
To raise their kids in safety. To have a future. That desire is deeper than ideology. It’s human.

I say this from a unique place. I love Israel — deeply. Spiritually. Historically. Prophetically.
But I also feel a strong attraction to Arabic culture — its language, its hospitality, its beauty and soul.

And that’s not a contradiction.
It’s proof that our world doesn’t have to remain divided.

We’ve been sold the myth that people must choose sides. That loving one means rejecting the other.
But maybe what we really need are more people who can stand in the tension — who carry love for both and are willing to listen, grieve, and hope beyond the headlines.

I believe peace starts with refusing to inherit someone else’s hatred.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your story.
