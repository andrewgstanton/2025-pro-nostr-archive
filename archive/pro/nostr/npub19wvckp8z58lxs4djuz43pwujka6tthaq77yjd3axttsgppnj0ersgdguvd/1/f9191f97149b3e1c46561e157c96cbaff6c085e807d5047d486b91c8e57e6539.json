  "content": "Would the Amish Use Bitcoin?\n\nIt’s a strange question at first glance.\n\nThe Amish—known for rejecting modern technology—don’t chase trends, don’t use electricity freely, and certainly don’t tweet about macro cycles or halving charts.\n\nBut maybe that’s exactly why the question matters.\n\nBecause Bitcoin isn’t modern in the way most tech is.\nIt doesn’t promise convenience.\nIt doesn’t scale via dopamine.\nIt doesn’t optimize for speed.\n\nBitcoin is slow, intentional, costly.\nIt’s rooted in proof. It resists inflation. It rewards work and punishes haste.\nIt doesn’t require trust in man—only math, energy, and time.\n\nThat sounds more Amish than Silicon Valley.\n\nThe Amish don’t reject technology outright—they reject tech that disrupts their values. If a tool harms the family, the community, or the soul, it’s out. But if it supports self-sovereignty, durability, and truth, they might quietly adopt it—even if only at the margins.\n\nSo would the Amish use Bitcoin?\n\nMaybe not openly. Maybe not digitally.\nBut they might accept it for what it is:\n\n🪙 Honest money.\n🛠 Proof of work.\n🌾 A return to cost, effort, and truth.\n\nAnd maybe that’s a question we all need to ask:\n\nIs this technology aligned with my values? Or does it hollow them out?\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer: I’ve never visited an Amish community—though I admire their conviction in many ways. The closest I’ve come was seeing a Mennonite couple in traditional dress strolling peacefully through the chaos of Waikiki years ago. The contrast struck me then—and still does.\n\n📝 Partially inspired by this thoughtful piece:\n\"The Amish Fertility Miracle (Part 1)\" by @f0xr on Primal\n\n🟠 Bitcoin doesn’t demand attention—it earns trust.\n\nIf that sounds more like tradition than tech, maybe we’re finally asking better questions.\n\nZap or reply if this sparked something.\nI’d love to hear your take—even if you’re not Amish 😉\n\n[zap here]: primal.net/andrewgstanton\n\n#Bitcoin #ProofOfWork #Amish #IntentionalLiving #DigitalMinimalism #ValuesDrivenTech #LowTimePreference #Sovereignty #SlowTech #FaithAndFinance #ZapLife #Nostr #Decentralization #TraditionMeetsTech #HardMoney #SimpleLiving #SelfSufficiency #Mennonite #CulturalContrast #InspiredByF0xr",
