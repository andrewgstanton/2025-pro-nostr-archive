# Christmas Eve (Dec. 24, 2025) Reflection III — Why I’m Writing This

I didn’t start Bitcoin Chronicles to predict the future.

I started it because I couldn’t find many stories willing to treat:

time as real

distance as meaningful

money as moral

technology as consequential

This is my attempt to think slowly — on purpose — about where sovereignty might still matter when convenience stops being free.
