A "Bridge" from Web3 to Bitcoin

I don’t feel fully visible in the Bitcoin world yet—and that’s OK.

What’s strange is feeling like I’ve outgrown Web3, but I’m not “established” in Bitcoin either. It’s like standing between two worlds.

I spent years in Web3 circles—DAO meetings, faith-tech groups, and mission-minded crypto spaces. I poured in energy. I learned a lot. And eventually, I realized the alignment wasn’t real. So I stepped back.

But I’m still grateful.

It was through CW3 that I first connected to Bitcoin Missions in India.

So no, it wasn’t wasted.

I’m walking forward now. Building slow. Stacking signal.

Even if the spotlight never finds me, I’ll keep showing up.

So this "Bridge" is a "Bridge" of history and growth not a technical one.

Proof of Work, not performance.
