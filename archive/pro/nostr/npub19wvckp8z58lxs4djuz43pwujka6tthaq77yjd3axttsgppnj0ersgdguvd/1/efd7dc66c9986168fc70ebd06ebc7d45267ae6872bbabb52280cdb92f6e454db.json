  "content": "Why Christians Should Care About Bitcoin\n(and what Proof of Work has to do with the Gospel)\n\nAt Bitcoin 2025, I met more Christians than I expected.\nNot at a church. Not in a small group.\nBut at a Bitcoin conference.\n\nBuilders. Thinkers. Dreamers. People who believe that truth matters—not just in theology, but in economics, technology, and daily life.\n\nIt confirmed something I’ve felt for a long time:\n\nBitcoin reflects Christian values more than most realize.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t flatter or inflate.\nIt doesn’t reward laziness or lies.\nIt operates on one clear condition: proof of work.\n\nThat resonates with the life of faith:\n\n“All hard work brings a profit,\nbut mere talk leads only to poverty.”\n— Proverbs 14:23\n\nWe aren’t saved by works—but once saved, we are called to work.\nNot to earn love, but to reflect it.\n\nBitcoin shares this ethic.\nIt’s voluntary. Transparent. Permissionless.\nYou don’t get ahead by gaming the system—you get there by contributing real energy to something bigger than yourself.\n\nThat sounds a lot like the Gospel.\n\nI also want to thank Dr. C for reminding me that what we’re doing here—building with conviction—matters. And yes, even AI tools, when used wisely, can amplify that message. I use them not to replace the truth, but to proclaim it farther and faster.\n\nI’m Andrew. I believe in the Victorious Gospel and the power of sound money.\nNot hype. Not hustle. But hope, rooted in reality.\n\n⸻\n\nZap ⚡ if this speaks to you.\nAnd if you’re a believer in both Christ and Bitcoin—keep building. You’re not alone.\n\n#Bitcoin #ProofOfWork #Faith #Christianity #VictoriousGospel #Bitcoin2025 #SovereignStewardship #AIForGood #DrC",
