Crypto/Web3: Just Another Form of Fiat

Crypto/Web3 → Fiat (yes, it's just new fiat)
Bitcoin ⇏ Fiat (Bitcoin is the rejection of fiat)

People think they’ve escaped fiat when they move from dollars to crypto.
But most of what passes for “crypto” today is just fiat in disguise.

Endless token creation.
Centralized teams pulling monetary levers.
VCs printing new supply and dumping it on users.
Communities driven by hype, not value.
Blockchains secured by vibes instead of work.

It’s the same game, just wrapped in code and jargon.

Bitcoin isn’t “crypto.”
Bitcoin is the exit.

Proof of Work matters.
Scarcity matters.
Skin in the game matters.
Everything else is just a new fiat casino.
