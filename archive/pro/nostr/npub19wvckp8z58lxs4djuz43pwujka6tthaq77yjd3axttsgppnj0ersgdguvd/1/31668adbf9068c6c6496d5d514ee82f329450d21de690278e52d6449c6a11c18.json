  "content": "🧡 Why I Post Here\n\nI don’t post on Nostr for money, likes, or clout.\nI post because I believe in Bitcoin, in truth, and in building things that last.\n\nYou won’t find gimmicks here.\nNo clickbait. No hype. Just thoughts, questions, and signals from the frontlines of faith, freedom, and proof-of-work.\n\nThat said — if something I write helps you see more clearly, think more deeply, or live more freely…\n\nFeel free to zap.\nEvery sat goes back into stacking, building, or supporting others doing the same.\n\nWe’re not here to go viral.\nWe’re here to build the next economy.\n\n— @andrewgstanton\n🟧 Zap address: ⚡ (andrewgstanton@primal.net\n📖 See my Series: [Why I Left Web3 for Proof of Work]",
