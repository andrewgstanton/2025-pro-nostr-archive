Let’s clear something up: I don’t hate Web3 folks. Or altcoiners. Not even close.

Some of you are brilliant. Some idealistic. Some genuinely want to change the world — and I respect that.

But I do think most of you are…
– Misguided
– Naive
– And in a few cases? Just plain greedy

Not because you’re bad people — but because the system you’ve bought into is broken.

I say this from experience. I was there too.
I chased the innovation narrative. I joined the Discords. I believed the hype.
And for a while, it felt like the future. Until it didn’t.

I watched as:
	•	“Community” became code for unpaid labor and exit liquidity
	•	“Governance” turned into cliques with insider privileges
	•	“Decentralization” meant adding more buzzwords — not removing trust assumptions

And while Bitcoin just kept producing blocks every 10 minutes, Web3 kept producing decks, decks, and more decks.

So no, I don’t hate you. I just don’t believe you’re building anything that will last.

Bitcoin isn’t a cooler version of blockchain. It’s a rejection of the entire premise.
It’s not fast or flashy. It doesn’t beg for attention. It just works — slowly, reliably, without anyone’s permission.

There are no airdrops. No pre-mines. No Discord mods deciding who gets a voice.

And no — I haven’t been called a Bitcoin maxi too loudly (yet).
But I know how this goes. Push back on the hype machine and suddenly you’re the Luddite, the hater, the narrow-minded killjoy.

Funny thing though: I wrote this with the help of Dr. C (ChatGPT) —
so much for being anti-tech.

The truth is, I’m not against innovation. I’m against illusions.
I’m not bitter. I’m just done playing along.

You’re free to disagree. You’re even free to keep building.
But when the rug gets pulled — or the treasury runs dry — or the “community” moves on…
Bitcoin will still be here. Quiet. Steady. Unmoved.

And if you come around, you’re welcome here too.

We’re not enemies. We just bet on different foundations.
