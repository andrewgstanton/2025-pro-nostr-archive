Everyone Matters—or No One Does

I think I’d treat Jack Dorsey or Michael Saylor the same way I’d treat my neighbor.
Not because I’m better than anyone—but because I genuinely believe that’s how we’re meant to live.

Bitcoin reinforces that.
Proof of Work doesn’t care who you are.
Your clout, your background, your “following”—none of it matters.
Only what you do.

That’s the world I want to help build.

But here’s what I’ve noticed—especially in Web3 and even some Christian spaces like CW3:

People say the right things.
“Mission.” “Transparency.” “Community.” “Kingdom.”
But behind the curtain, there’s a hierarchy.
Unspoken tiers. Inner circles. Special treatment for the “visionaries.”

You can feel it.
Replies are rationed.
Access is based on your visibility, not your heart.
And if you question it—you’re labeled “divisive” or “negative.”

That’s not truth. That’s branding.

I’ve reached out to some of these folks—not out of neediness, but genuine interest.
Sometimes they respond.
Often, they don’t.
And that’s okay. I don’t take it personally anymore.

But it is unsettling.
Because it reveals something we don’t like to admit:
Most people don’t actually want transparency.
They want the appearance of authenticity… without the discomfort.
They want curated “realness”—as long as it still advances their goals.

But I’m here for something deeper.
I’m not here to win at the game.
I’m here to walk away from it—and help build something better.

A world where your proof of work is your credibility.
Where love isn’t selective.
Where freedom isn’t filtered by fame.

That’s the world I believe in.
And I know I’m not the only one.
