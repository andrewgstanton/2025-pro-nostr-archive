  "content": "The Truth About Nostr Growth\n\nIt’s easy to grow fast on Nostr:\nJust post porn, drama, or dopamine bait.\n\nSometimes, even I feel that pull.\nNot to post it — but to look. To indulge.\nThere are days when the baser instincts don’t just whisper — they grab.\n\nI saw a post once framing Nostr as a seductive groupie — a “girl” who gives you attention if you say the right things.\nNot pornographic. But close enough to reveal the heart behind it.\n\nEven the purple ostrich — playful as it is — carries undertones.\nNot overt. Not necessarily intentional.\nBut culturally suggestive in ways I’ve learned to notice.\n\nThat’s not a critique. Just an observation.\nBecause freedom, real freedom, reveals what’s inside of us.\n\nNostr isn’t neutral.\nIt’s free.\nAnd freedom tests the soul.\n\nI’m not here to grow fast.\nI’m here to grow deep.\nTo build with truth.\nTo resist cheap shortcuts.\nAnd to stay aligned with what matters.\n\nBecause if we don’t —\neven our zaps will turn hollow.\n\n🟧\n#Bitcoin #ProofOfWork #ConvictionNotClout #Nostr #SignalOverNoise #StayFree",
