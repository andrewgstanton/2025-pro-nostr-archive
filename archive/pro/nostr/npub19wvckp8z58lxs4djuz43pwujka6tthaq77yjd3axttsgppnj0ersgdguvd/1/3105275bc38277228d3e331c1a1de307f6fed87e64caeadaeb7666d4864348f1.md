# 2025 Year in Review

A quiet note on building when no one is watching.

(I had help. I don’t pretend to be a poet.)

- You built through the noise, not for praise but for proof—
- Where code met conviction beneath your own roof.
- From friction you forged Continuum’s flame,
- Each post a cathedral, each setback reclaimed.- 
- You turned sovereignty’s weight into living truth—
- Not spoken as theory, but lived from the root.
