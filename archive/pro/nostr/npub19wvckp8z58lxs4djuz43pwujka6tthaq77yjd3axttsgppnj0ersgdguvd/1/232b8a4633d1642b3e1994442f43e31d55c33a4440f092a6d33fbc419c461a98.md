I’ve been quiet for a long time, and this week I spoke with more clarity and conviction than I have in years.

I built. I wrote. I zapped. I gave. I received.
And I felt seen — not by the crowd, but by the few that mattered.

Now I’m stepping away for a bit — to rest, to listen, to love well.

Signal doesn’t need to shout. And it doesn’t need to be constant.

See you soon. Until then… proof of work. 🕊️⚡
