I don’t fit easily into one box.

I’m a Bitcoin maximalist who collaborates with AI.
A lover of Israel drawn to Arabic culture.
A theological thinker writing for tech-savvy audiences.
A builder who critiques hype — and a critic who still builds.
A reformer shaped by disillusionment, still choosing hope.

I believe in the Victorious Gospel — not a gospel of fear, but of reconciliation, renewal, and restoration.
A God who actually wins.
A future where even enemies become family.

I’m not here to be packaged. I’m here to live and speak truth.
And if that makes me hard to categorize… good.
