Why I Trade Equities but Not Crypto

I’m often asked why I actively trade equities but don’t touch altcoins.

The short version? Transparency, liquidity, and real-world value.

Equities represent ownership in real businesses with earnings, cash flow, and regulatory oversight. I can analyze them, hedge them, and exit them with precision. It’s a market—not a casino.

Crypto (outside of Bitcoin) feels like the opposite. Thin liquidity, insider games, opaque tokenomics, and often... no real product.

I trade to generate daily income. I stack Bitcoin to preserve long-term wealth.

Trading altcoins would blur that line.
