A follow is more than a click. They’re signs of presence, attention, and shared signal. And I want to honor that.\n\nThis space isn’t about clout. It’s about connection. Quiet signal > loud noise.\n\n⚡️If my posts resonate, feel free to zap — it helps me keep writing and building here.\n\n#bitcoin, #nostr, #proofOfWork, #signalNotNoise, #buildWithConviction, #zaplife",
