With the courage to love when it costs something.\n\nWhether you’re a dad, a mentor, a spiritual father, or walking with a father’s heart—thank you.\n\nYou are seen. You are needed.\nYour work echoes into eternity.\n\n#FathersDay #Fatherhood #Legacy #DadLife #Gratitude #ProtectAndProvide #FamilyFirst #SilentStrength #ProofOfWork #BlessedToBeDad\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/4d80804ba0ef193d7d9758c7b8026aff0b4c6ef17fbb82fc05a74978f471a961.png",
