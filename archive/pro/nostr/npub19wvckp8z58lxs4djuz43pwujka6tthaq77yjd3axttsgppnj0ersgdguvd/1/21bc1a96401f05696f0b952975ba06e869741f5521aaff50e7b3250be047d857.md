No Loss Days Since March 14, 2025!

In early March, I experienced a major trading loss—one that forced me to face everything I’d been avoiding about risk, posture, and discipline.

Since March 14, I haven’t had a single loss day.

Not because the market got easier. Because I got clearer.

I started journaling. I tracked every trade. I restructured my allocations—10% to BTC, 10% to direct support.

Every day since then has been about consistency, clarity, and quiet rebuilding.

I still remember the pain—but I carry it now as proof of work.

This isn’t a comeback story. It’s a realignment story.

NOTE: To be clear, I ONLY trade equities through an e-trade account, I don't trade cryptocurrencies (I used to).  The allocations are based on total trading gains for the week.
