  "content": "Why I Trade Equities but Not Crypto\n\n https://blossom.primal.net/b384d8305b91eb4eeb7172d899a79f6756461fe68486729ea68166cc669b1d8a.png \n\nI’m often asked why I actively trade equities but don’t touch altcoins.\n\nThe short version? Transparency, liquidity, and real-world value.\n\nEquities represent ownership in real businesses with earnings, cash flow, and regulatory oversight. I can analyze them, hedge them, and exit them with precision. It’s a market—not a casino.\n\nCrypto (outside of Bitcoin) feels like the opposite. Thin liquidity, insider games, opaque tokenomics, and often... no real product.\n\nI trade to generate daily income. I stack Bitcoin to preserve long-term wealth.\n\nTrading altcoins would blur that line.\n\n#ProofOfWork #EquitiesNotAltcoins #BitcoinOnly #nostr\n\n",
