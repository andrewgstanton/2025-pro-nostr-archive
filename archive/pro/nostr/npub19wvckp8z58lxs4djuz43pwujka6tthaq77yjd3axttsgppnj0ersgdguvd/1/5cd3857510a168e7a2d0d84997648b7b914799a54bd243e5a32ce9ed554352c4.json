But for me, it’s not.\n\nI don’t worship Bitcoin—I value what it represents: honesty, transparency, resistance to corruption, and a system no man can rig. That’s not idolatry. That’s discernment.\n\nI believe Jesus is Lord. Not Bitcoin. But I also believe the love of fiat money—the kind created by decree and manipulation—has done far more spiritual harm than the pursuit of hard money ever has.\n\nIf anything, Bitcoin has revealed my own idols: comfort, control, validation from broken systems.\n\nI don't follow Bitcoin because it's perfect. I follow it because it aligns with a deeper truth:\n💡 You shall know them by their fruits.\n\nAnd the fruit of Bitcoin? It's not greed. It's sovereignty. Responsibility. Stewardship.\n\nYes, some are only in it for personal gain. That’s true in any system. But for me, Bitcoin is a tool—not just for financial freedom, but for spiritual clarity.\n\n📖 “The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” – 1 Timothy 6:10\n📖 “You cannot serve God and Mammon.” – Matthew 6:24\n\nI’m not serving Mammon. I’m trying to break free from it.\nI want to use Bitcoin as a tool to help others—both financially and spiritually.\n\n🛠 Notes:\n– Written with help from ChatGPT (ideation, editing, and metrics)\n– Zap if this hits. Ask if it doesn’t.\n\n#BitcoinNotIdol\n#MammonVsBitcoin\n#ChristianBitcoiner\n#FaithAndFinance\n#SoundMoney\n#HardMoney\n#Sovereignty\n#JesusIsLord\n#BreakFreeFromFiat\n#ProofOfWorkNotWorship\n\n",
