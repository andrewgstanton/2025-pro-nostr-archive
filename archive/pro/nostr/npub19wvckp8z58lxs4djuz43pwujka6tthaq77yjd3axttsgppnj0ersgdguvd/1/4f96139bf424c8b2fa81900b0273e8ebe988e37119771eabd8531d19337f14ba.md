Why Games Still Matter

I haven’t posted much about games. But after getting a zap from @jacob—who mentioned he’s looking to follow more people who play games on Nostr—it got me thinking:

Why do games matter? And what does it mean to build a world where play is taken seriously?

Back in 2009, I briefly worked at a company building educational games with Adobe Flash. It was early—and clunky—but the goal was timeless: engage the mind, reward effort, and turn learning into something joyful.

We didn’t call it “gamification” yet, but that’s what it was:
🎯 Design for feedback.
🔁 Make progress visible.
🚀 Let people grow through play.

Games are some of the only systems left where the rules are clear, feedback is instant, and effort leads to progress. In a world of rigged systems and invisible gatekeepers, that’s radical.

It’s why people burn out at jobs but stay up late playing games.
It’s why Bitcoin and Nostr—while not games—feel gameful:

You earn what you prove.

You grow through action.

You play in open space, not closed loops.

Gamification isn’t about points or badges.
It’s about building systems where people want to keep showing up.
Where feedback builds mastery—not addiction.
Where risk and reward are fair.

We need more of that—across tech, education, even faith.

🟠 Thanks to `@jac0b` for the zap and reminder.
I’d love to hear from others who are building or playing in this space.
What have games taught you? And where do you see this going?

Zap, reply, or follow as I keep building without permission—but with purpose.
