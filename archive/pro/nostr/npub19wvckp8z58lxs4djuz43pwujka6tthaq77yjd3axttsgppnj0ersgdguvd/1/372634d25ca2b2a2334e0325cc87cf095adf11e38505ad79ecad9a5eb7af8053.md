🧱 Part 3 is live: The Return

I didn’t just come back to Bitcoin. I came back to limits that meant something.
Time. Cost. Truth.
Reading The Bitcoin Standard didn’t just shift how I think about money — it reframed how I see trust, work, and even faith.

This return isn’t loud.
But it’s deep.
And it’s real.

⚡ If it resonates, zap me some sats — or pass it forward.
