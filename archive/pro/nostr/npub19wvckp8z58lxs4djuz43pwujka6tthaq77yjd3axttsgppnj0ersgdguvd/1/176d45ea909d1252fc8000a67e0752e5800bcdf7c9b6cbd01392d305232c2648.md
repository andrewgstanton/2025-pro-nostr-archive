# Why do I write articles instead of posting notes?

Long-form writing helps me express ideas more fully. Especially on Nostr, I’m not constrained by length, tone, or format.

I explore sovereignty and freedom — and at times theology — in ways that don’t compress well into short posts. Essays give those ideas room to breathe.
