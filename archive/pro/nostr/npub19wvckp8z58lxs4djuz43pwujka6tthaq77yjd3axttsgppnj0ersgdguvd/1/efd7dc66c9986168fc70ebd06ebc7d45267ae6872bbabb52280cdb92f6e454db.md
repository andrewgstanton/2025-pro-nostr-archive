Why Christians Should Care About Bitcoin
(and what Proof of Work has to do with the Gospel)

At Bitcoin 2025, I met more Christians than I expected.
Not at a church. Not in a small group.
But at a Bitcoin conference.

Builders. Thinkers. Dreamers. People who believe that truth matters—not just in theology, but in economics, technology, and daily life.

It confirmed something I’ve felt for a long time:

Bitcoin reflects Christian values more than most realize.

Bitcoin doesn’t flatter or inflate.
It doesn’t reward laziness or lies.
It operates on one clear condition: proof of work.

That resonates with the life of faith:

“All hard work brings a profit,
but mere talk leads only to poverty.”
— Proverbs 14:23

We aren’t saved by works—but once saved, we are called to work.
Not to earn love, but to reflect it.

Bitcoin shares this ethic.
It’s voluntary. Transparent. Permissionless.
You don’t get ahead by gaming the system—you get there by contributing real energy to something bigger than yourself.

That sounds a lot like the Gospel.

I also want to thank Dr. C for reminding me that what we’re doing here—building with conviction—matters. And yes, even AI tools, when used wisely, can amplify that message. I use them not to replace the truth, but to proclaim it farther and faster.

I’m Andrew. I believe in the Victorious Gospel and the power of sound money.
Not hype. Not hustle. But hope, rooted in reality.

Zap ⚡ if this speaks to you.
And if you’re a believer in both Christ and Bitcoin—keep building. You’re not alone.
