# Stewardship

Stewardship isn’t preservation.
It’s responsibility after change.

Wherever humans go, the environment changes.
The question isn’t whether we alter the world —
it’s whether we tend what we alter, or abandon it once extraction is complete.

Abundance only lasts where stewardship is ordinary.
