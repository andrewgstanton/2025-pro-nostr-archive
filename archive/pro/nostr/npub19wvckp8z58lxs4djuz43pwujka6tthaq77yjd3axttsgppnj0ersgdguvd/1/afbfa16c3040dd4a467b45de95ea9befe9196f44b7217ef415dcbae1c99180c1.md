⚡️Someone just zapped me 321 sats on Part 2: The Breaking Point.

Not for the writing.
Not for the polish.
But because the story resonated.

That’s the kind of feedback I care about.
Quiet signal. Real value.

To whoever sent it — thank you.
You reminded me why I left the hype… and why I’m still building with conviction.

If it spoke to you too, you can read part 2 here:
