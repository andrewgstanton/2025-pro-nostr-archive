# Old Twitter handle hacked

This week my old Twitter handle got hacked.
X support? Silence.

On Nostr, this isn’t possible. I own my keys. My content. My multiple identities.

Continuum makes this seamless.

Web2: you rent your identity.
Web3: you pawn it to a token.
Nostr: you own it — fully, forever. 🔑⚡️
