🌱 Day 2: ʻĀina Isn’t Real Estate — It’s Identity
In Hawaiian, the word for land — ʻāina — comes from ʻai, to eat.

ʻĀina isn’t just dirt. It’s that which feeds us. That which grounds us.

The overthrow of Hawai‘i wasn’t just political. It was a disruption of this connection — between people, land, and meaning.

Land was stolen. Culture was suppressed. Ownership became legal, not sacred.

And now, some try to reclaim that loss by calling for a separate “homeland” within the State of Hawai‘i.

I don’t believe that would help — not for Native Hawaiians, and not for locals who were born and raised here.

What would help?
Remembering the past.
Honoring Hawaiian arts, language, and culture.
Building systems that respect land, time, and dignity — without walls or exclusions.

That’s why I believe in Bitcoin.
It protects what you own without permission.
It treats ownership as sacred again.

Sovereignty doesn’t have to mean secession. It can mean wholeness.

Aloha ʻāina — not as protest, but as presence.
