Leaving Bitcoin 2025 with more than I came with.

I arrived carrying a lot:
Conviction. Silence. Hope. Some scars from spaces I used to trust.

I’m leaving with something I didn’t expect:
	•	Dinner with two Christian day traders
	•	A quiet nod from a focused Nostr dev
	•	An Uber ride that turned into shared faith
	•	A long, inspiring talk with Black Bitcoiners building in Kenya
	•	A pass for Bitcoin 2026
	•	And a new book: “Would Mao Hold Bitcoin?” —
paid for in sats, received with gratitude, author to reader

None of this was orchestrated.
None of it was self-promotional.
It was just… real.

God keeps confirming:
I’m exactly where I need to be.
No need to force doors open.
Just keep showing up.
