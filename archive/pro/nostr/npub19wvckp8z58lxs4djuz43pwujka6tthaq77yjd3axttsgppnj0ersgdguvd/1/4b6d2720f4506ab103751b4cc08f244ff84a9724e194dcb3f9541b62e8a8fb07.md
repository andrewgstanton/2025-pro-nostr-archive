After the Gravity

Summary

A reflection after the conversation with nostr:nprofile1qqsr26r4lltjnvrwadxp67ns58m4qpzaqemhf5sup7hlujhjh7t296qpr3mhxue69uhkummnw3ezucnfw33k76twv4ezuum0vd5kzmqppamhxue69uhkumewwd68ytnrwg5pml9e  nostr:nprofile1qqsr37dqts0p3qzpp2yegvn03ujyt6hj97djkmqn6tcfrrvedxvlcpqpramhxue69uhkummnw3ez6vpj9ejx7unpveskxar0wfujummjvuhsz8nhwden5te0dehhxarj94c82c3wwajkcmr0wfjx2u3wdejhgtcl28a8f and others—on how grace draws hearts the same way gravity binds galaxies.

The recent  zap notifications surprised me—not because of the sats, but because of the resonance.
When words about the sovereignty of God stir both reverence and relief, something real is happening. It’s as if grace itself vibrates through the network, echoing from soul to soul.

They were acknowledgments of the same pull. Even those who see theology differently can feel when the center holds.

I keep thinking about that: how love exerts gravity.

We orbit it, resist it, misread it—but we cannot escape it.

Calvinists call it sovereignty. Mystics call it union. 

Physicists call it attraction.

I just call it Christ.

His holiness isn’t a static throne above us—it’s the living core within all things, drawing every fragment back into coherence. 

Judgment is not just His anger (sometimes it is) but His weight—the pressure of truth collapsing pride into light.

So yes, onward indeed.
Every debate, every difference, every small spark of understanding—these are just eddies in the larger current. 

The gravity of grace is doing what it always does: pulling everything home.

“And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Myself.” — John 12:32
