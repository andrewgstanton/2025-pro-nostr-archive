  "content": "I went through some of the same questions first few days of using nostr, hope I can help , this was the easiest way for me:\n\n1. download the mobile app for nostr, login using your private key\n\n2. enable the wallet in the mobile app. (settings -> wallet -> start in wallet)\n(it will automatically give you a lightning address that updates your profile (mine is wittmoth13@primal.net)\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/f55c32c5dc4326afd6547d5556455da735c23010aadcab7fd15719336c8f98cf.png \n\n\n 3. In your web application primal (log in using your private key), connect the primal wallet (settings -> connected wallets -> Connect).  Mine is enabled, but I showed the screen as you would see it, screenshot below:\n\n https://blossom.primal.net/ec43e91688667ea74e69a074e2389712f7627568c5a19b345fcc8680c43f1e97.png \n\n4. One it's connected you should be able to receive and send sats\n(once you have zap enabled, let me know I will zap you some)",
