🌺 Akamai Sovereignty — Day 6: True Aloha Respects Property

Aloha isn’t just a greeting. It’s a way of being — rooted in love, respect, and responsibility.

But too often, "aloha" is weaponized: used to justify handouts, hostility, or control.

True aloha respects boundaries.
And real sovereignty means building something of your own — not demanding what someone else has.

🟠 Land back? Only if it's freely sold.
🟠 Leasehold (like Bishop Estate) restricts real ownership. It’s control dressed as culture.
🟠 You can’t own land on a reservation, in most of Israel, or most of the Arab world. That’s not sovereignty — that’s dependence.
🟠 Bitcoin gives us a model: total ownership, zero censorship — but you must earn it.

Sovereignty = Ownership + Responsibility.
No shortcuts. No guilt leverage. Just honest work, free exchange, and respect.

Do I really want sovereignty —
or do I want someone else to build my paradise for me?

Do I honor my ancestors by reclaiming land —
or by building new value?

Let’s choose the harder path — and the freer one.
