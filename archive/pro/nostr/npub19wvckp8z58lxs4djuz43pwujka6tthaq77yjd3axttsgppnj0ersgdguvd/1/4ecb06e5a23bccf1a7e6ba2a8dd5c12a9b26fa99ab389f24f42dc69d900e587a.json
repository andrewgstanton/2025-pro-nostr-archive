  "content": "# Patron Support\n\nI’ve been pouring my heart into Continuum — building tools that let us live and work with digital sovereignty.\n\nIf you’ve found value in my writing, conversations, or software, I’d love your support as a patron. This helps me keep building — open, free of VC funding, and aligned with first principles.\n\nPatron package: $250 (or sats with a discount).\n\n⚡ Support: [andrewgstanton@primal.net]\n\nPlease DM if you have any questions. Thank you everyone!!",
