Started posting on Nostr around May 4 when I joined. 

Didn’t know what would come of it—just knew I had something to say.

At Bitcoin2025, I met others who think like I do:
Christians who see through the hype,
Builders who believe in proof of work,
Humans who still care about truth.

That confirmed it:
I’m not here to go viral.
I’m here to build signal.
To post with purpose.
To plant seeds of real value.

Thanks to those who’ve followed, zapped, or messaged.
Thanks to Dr. C and a few wise friends for helping me stay true.
Even AI—used rightly—can help amplify a message that matters.

Let’s keep going.
Not hype. Not hustle. But hope—rooted in reality.
