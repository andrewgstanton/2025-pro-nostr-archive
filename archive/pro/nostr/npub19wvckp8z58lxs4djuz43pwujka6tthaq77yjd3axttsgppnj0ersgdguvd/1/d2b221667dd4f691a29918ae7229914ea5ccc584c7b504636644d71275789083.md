What Would the Amish Ask ChatGPT?

Most people approach ChatGPT by asking what it can do.
But I think the Amish would ask a different set of questions.

They wouldn’t begin with productivity or features.
They’d start with values.

What does this tool do to the soul?

Does it serve the family, the church, the community?

Does it bring us closer to the truth—or just simulate it faster?

Does it help us raise our children—or replace the teacher?

Does it deepen our wisdom—or just widen our bandwidth?

The Amish don’t reject every technology—they reject technologies that disrupt the fabric of life they’re trying to preserve. If a tool harms communion, self-sufficiency, or faith, they say no—even if it works.

So what would they make of ChatGPT?

They might call it impressive, even useful.
But they’d ask what it costs to use it every day.
They’d wonder what skills, what attentiveness, what reliance on God gets quietly traded away.

And maybe they’d remind us that a tool isn’t neutral just because it’s digital.

⚠️ For the record: I’m not Amish. Never even visited an Amish community. But I admire their discipline, their boundary-drawing, and their quiet resistance to the world’s constant acceleration.

What do you think ChatGPT is doing to us?

Zap or reply. I’d love to hear your thoughts—even if you use AI to write them 😉

⚠️ For the record: I’m not Amish. Never even visited an Amish community. I probably wouldn’t be comfortable living that way—I’m compelled to build, to tell stories, and I do that through technology. But I deeply admire the Amish commitment to honesty, to discernment, and to living in alignment with what they believe. That kind of coherence is rare—and I want more of it in my own way.
