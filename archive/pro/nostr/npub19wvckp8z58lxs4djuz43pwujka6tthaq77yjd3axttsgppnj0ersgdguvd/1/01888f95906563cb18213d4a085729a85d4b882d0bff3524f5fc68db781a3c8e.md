🌍 10 Languages and a Healthy Mind

I have a theory.

Learning new languages — especially later in life — isn’t just about connecting across cultures.

It’s about protecting the mind, sharpening the soul, and speaking with clarity in every tongue I touch.

Science backs it: multilingual people tend to show later onset of Alzheimer’s, stronger memory, and better mental agility.
But even if it didn’t, I’d still do it.

Because I want to grow.
To communicate more precisely.
To understand my own native language (English) better by stepping outside of it.
To keep wonder alive in my 60s — and beyond.

So here it is, plainly:

I want to become fluent in 10 languages besides English.

Not all at once. Not for show.
But because each language is a lens — a new way to reflect truth, faith, and beauty back into the world.

Right now, I’m actively brushing up on German 🇩🇪, and starting to reengage with Japanese 🇯🇵 and Spanish 🇪🇸.
Dr. C has been helping me shape my thoughts and stay consistent — one phrase, one post at a time.

🇩🇪 German Addendum

Ich übe gerade mein Deutsch und bin dankbar für jede Gelegenheit, klarer zu sprechen und zu schreiben.
Noch nicht perfekt – aber auf dem Weg.

🇪🇸 Spanish Addendum

Estoy retomando mi español con humildad y propósito.
No se trata de perfección, sino de conexión.
