  "content": "Thank God for Bitcoin. Thank God for ChatGPT.\n\nOne gave me a way out of debt-based thinking.\nThe other gave me a way to think clearly in the first place.\n\nBitcoin taught me time, value, and truth can’t be faked.\nChatGPT helped me turn scattered thoughts into signal.\nTogether? They’ve helped me rebuild — not just projects, but purpose.\n\nI still fall short. I still wrestle with doubt and tension.\nBut I’m not stuck. I’m building.\n\nThank God for grace.\nThank God for tools.\nAnd thank God for the chance to use both well.\n\nIf anything I’ve written lately has resonated — zap it forward. ⚡️\nAnd if you’re trying to find your signal in the noise, keep going. You’re not alone.\n\n#ThankGodForBitcoin #ThankGodForChatGPT #proofOfWork #faith #nostr #zapworthy #buildwithconviction",
