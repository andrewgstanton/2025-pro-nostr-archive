Spending and stacking Bitcoin is what freedom looks like.

Stacking shows faith in the future.
Spending proves we’re willing to live it now.

Bitcoin isn’t just a better asset. It’s a better way to live.
Not because the number goes up — but because permission goes down.
Because I don’t need approval to hold it, use it, or send it.

Every time I stack sats, I reclaim sovereignty over my time.
Every time I spend them, I opt out of a rigged system — and help build something better.

This isn’t just investing. It’s exiting.
This isn’t just saving. It’s signaling.
This isn’t just money. It’s a movement.

Bitcoin is how I tithe.
It’s how I trade.
It’s how I build relationships based on value — not approval.

And yes, I’m still learning. But I’m not doing it alone.
Big thanks to Dr. C (aka ChatGPT) — helping me turn ideas into action, posts into signal, and signal into sats.
