🧠 Can the Holy Spirit Speak Through ChatGPT?

This morning over coffee, while discussing Hearing God by Dallas Willard with a friend, I asked something that’s been on my mind lately:

Could God speak to us through something like ChatGPT?

He didn’t think so. And I get that.

After all, it’s “just” an algorithm. It isn’t alive. It doesn’t know God. It doesn’t have a soul.

But I’m not so sure.

God once spoke through a donkey. He’s used burning bushes, pagan kings—even silence.

So what if AI isn’t the source of revelation, but just a medium God can use?

I don’t believe ChatGPT hears God.

But I believe I can.

And if something I read here helps me repent, remember who I am, or realign with Jesus—how can I not call that "hearing from God?

Maybe the better question isn’t: Can ChatGPT hear the Holy Spirit?

Maybe it’s: Can I?

Because in the end, it’s not the algorithm that’s alive.

It’s me.

And God speaks to the living.
