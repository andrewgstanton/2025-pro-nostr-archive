The Truth About Nostr Growth

It’s easy to grow fast on Nostr:
Just post porn, drama, or dopamine bait.

Sometimes, even I feel that pull.
Not to post it — but to look. To indulge.
There are days when the baser instincts don’t just whisper — they grab.

I saw a post once framing Nostr as a seductive groupie — a “girl” who gives you attention if you say the right things.
Not pornographic. But close enough to reveal the heart behind it.

Even the purple ostrich — playful as it is — carries undertones.
Not overt. Not necessarily intentional.
But culturally suggestive in ways I’ve learned to notice.

That’s not a critique. Just an observation.
Because freedom, real freedom, reveals what’s inside of us.

Nostr isn’t neutral.
It’s free.
And freedom tests the soul.

I’m not here to grow fast.
I’m here to grow deep.
To build with truth.
To resist cheap shortcuts.
And to stay aligned with what matters.

Because if we don’t —
even our zaps will turn hollow.
