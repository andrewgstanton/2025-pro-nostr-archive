I’m Not a Dual Citizen. I’m Not a Puppet. I’m a Bitcoiner Who Still Believes in Truth.

This week I responded to a widely circulated, fabricated quote falsely attributed to Benjamin Netanyahu — a quote that has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations and originated in antisemitic forums.

I shared that truth calmly.

No attacks. No slurs. Just facts.

In return, I was met with:
	•	Mockery.
	•	A veiled antisemitic “dual citizen” accusation.
	•	A wave of projection that implies anyone who challenges the “Zionist control” narrative must be part of it.

That response — especially from someone I had just given sats to for a thoughtful earlier comment — was disappointing. But sadly, it wasn’t surprising.

🧱 What I Actually Believe

So let me be clear for anyone who’s unsure:
	•	I don’t believe Israel or “the Jews” are behind everything.
	•	I don’t believe America is a puppet state controlled by Zionists.
	•	I don’t believe every act of war by Israel is justified.
	•	I also don’t believe that defending Jewish sovereignty, calling out lies, or rejecting antisemitic dog whistles makes someone compromised or bought.

I believe in truth, sovereignty, and accountability — and that means I refuse to spread conspiracy theories, no matter how popular they are in “freedom” spaces.

⚡ If That Gets Me Mocked, So Be It

I didn’t come to Bitcoin for a new set of tribal lies. I came here for truth.
	•	If calling out fake quotes gets me labeled a “dual citizen” — fine.
	•	If defending the right of Jews to exist and return to their homeland makes me a target — so be it.
	•	If decentralization only applies when it’s politically convenient, then maybe it’s not decentralization at all.

🕊️ A Final Word

You don’t have to like Netanyahu.
You don’t have to support every Israeli policy.
But you do have to resist the urge to flatten history into slogans, and people into enemies.

Bitcoin is either built on truth — or it’s just another ideology waiting to collapse.

I’m choosing truth.

I won’t drag this out. I just won’t pretend it didn’t happen.
