  "content": "A \"Bridge\" from Web3 to Bitcoin\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/76e2f29961ef862fa3dccd5ed5f229721bc18e2abb62dcebdb3955732f0c01d9.png\n\nI don’t feel fully visible in the Bitcoin world yet—and that’s OK.\n\nWhat’s strange is feeling like I’ve outgrown Web3, but I’m not “established” in Bitcoin either. It’s like standing between two worlds.\n\nI spent years in Web3 circles—DAO meetings, faith-tech groups, and mission-minded crypto spaces. I poured in energy. I learned a lot. And eventually, I realized the alignment wasn’t real. So I stepped back.\n\nBut I’m still grateful.\n\nIt was through CW3 that I first connected to Bitcoin Missions in India.\n\nSo no, it wasn’t wasted.\n\nI’m walking forward now. Building slow. Stacking signal.\n\nEven if the spotlight never finds me, I’ll keep showing up.\n\nSo this \"Bridge\" is a \"Bridge\" of history and growth not a technical one.\n\nProof of Work, not performance.\n\n#BitcoinMissions #ProofOfWork\n",
