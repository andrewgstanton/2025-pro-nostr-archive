🪨 Day 1: A Nation Remembered — And a Deeper Sovereignty

🇬🇧 In 1843, the Kingdom of Hawai‘i was recognized as a sovereign nation by Britain and France.

That sovereignty was never lawfully ceded.
In 1893, it was overthrown — not by a vote, not by a movement, but by outside force.

I wasn’t born in Hawai‘i. I’m not ethnically Hawaiian. I was born in Palau.
But two of my siblings were born in Hawai‘i, and the stories of that land shaped my sense of justice — and my respect for true sovereignty.

I’m also a patriotic American. And I believe patriotism includes the courage to face hard truths about our past.

What makes the overthrow even more painful is this: Hawai‘i supported the Union during the American Civil War.
Native Hawaiians volunteered. Confederate ships were barred from Hawaiian ports.

The Kingdom aligned itself morally with American freedom — and was betrayed by the very nation it once stood with.

And yet, Hawai‘i is now a state — and that reality matters too.
Many are proud to be both Hawaiian and American. Statehood brought new rights, protections, and recognition — but also new tensions.

I don’t believe sovereignty has to mean secession.
It can mean living with dignity, owning your future, and reclaiming truth without permission.

That’s why I choose Bitcoin.
It honors time, land, and truth — not politics.

Hawai‘i was a nation. It is now a state. But its story — and its people — still teach us what it means to be free.
