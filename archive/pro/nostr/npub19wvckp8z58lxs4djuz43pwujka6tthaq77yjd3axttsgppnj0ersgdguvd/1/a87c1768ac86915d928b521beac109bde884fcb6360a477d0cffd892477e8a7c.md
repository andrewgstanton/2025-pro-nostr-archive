🌊 Day 3: What Could’ve Been — A Sovereign Ally
What if Hawai‘i had never been overthrown?
What if the Kingdom had continued — not as an isolated monarchy, but as a sovereign partner?

We don’t have to guess wildly. Just look at Palau and Micronesia.

They were never permanently U.S. territories.
And yet today, they enjoy strong, peaceful relations with the United States — with defense, currency, and visa agreements in place, but with their sovereignty intact.

I believe Hawai‘i could have followed that path.
A sovereign nation. A trusted ally.
Like the Kingdom of Tonga. Like Western Samoa (American Samoa is a US territory).  

Instead, it was forcibly annexed.
Its monarchy was dismantled.
Its language suppressed.

Statehood came later — and yes, there were benefits.
But there was no meaningful choice. No consent of the governed.

We can’t change the past. But we can learn from it.

Sovereignty doesn’t have to mean separation. It means dignity.

It means building relationships that are chosen — not imposed.

That’s why I believe in Bitcoin.
It lets us opt in. It respects our agency.

Sovereignty isn’t about rebellion. It’s about consent.
And that matters now more than ever.
