# Sovereign Publishing

Everyone’s talking about **Bitchat** — sovereign messaging on Nostr.
It proves what’s possible:

- No phone numbers
- No platforms
- Just npubs, relays, and sats

That’s what we need across the board. Bitchat for chat. Continuum for publishing.

Today I shipped my first gated article using a similar model: teaser (free), zap (500 sats), full article (encrypted DM).

It's similar because ** No Patreon. No Substack. No PayPal. Just sats → content.**

Sovereign chat. Sovereign publishing. The future is arriving piece by piece.
