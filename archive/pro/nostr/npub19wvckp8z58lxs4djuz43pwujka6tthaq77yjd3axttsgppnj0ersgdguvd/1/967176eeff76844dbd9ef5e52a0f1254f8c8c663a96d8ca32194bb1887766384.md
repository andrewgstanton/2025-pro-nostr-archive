There’s a kind of service that starts with the right heart...
but ends up feeling more like a performance.

I’ve been part of communities—faith-based, tech-leaning, recovery-focused—that organize well.
They send thoughtful emails. They assign roles. They light candles. They pray.

And yet, something inside me keeps asking:

Where’s the weight?
Where’s the actual transformation?
Is this real help—or just a curated moment of compassion?

I don’t doubt the sincerity.
But sincerity without structure becomes sentiment.
And sentiment without follow-through becomes theater.

I’m not angry. I’m just hungry—for something deeper.

For community that feels less like casting calls and more like shared labor.
For service that isn’t stylized, but sustained.
For impact that doesn’t end when the applause fades.

Lord, help us trade stage lights for fruit.
Help us put the costumes down.
Help us love in ways that don’t always photograph well—but heal deeply.

Amen.
