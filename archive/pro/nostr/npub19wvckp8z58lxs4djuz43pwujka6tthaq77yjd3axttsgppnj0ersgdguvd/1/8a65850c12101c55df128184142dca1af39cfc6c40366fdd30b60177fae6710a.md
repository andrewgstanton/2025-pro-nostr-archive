🧠 What Kind of Bitcoiner Are You?
There’s no single kind of Bitcoiner.

Some of us are here for the money.
Some for the mission.
Some stumbled in through mining, memes, or Michael Saylor.
Some came for the yield—and stayed for the ethos.
Some stack quietly. Others preach. Some build.

Me?
I used to wander through Web3—curious, hopeful, but unsettled.
Now I’m anchored. Not perfect, not loud, but aligned.
I trade equities. I stack sats. I tithe in Bitcoin.
I believe Proof of Work isn’t just a protocol—it’s a posture.

I’ve been developing software for over 35 years—but I’ve yet to touch Bitcoin Core.
I’d like to.
And maybe that’s part of the journey too.

So I’m asking—not to judge, but to learn:
What kind of Bitcoiner are you?
