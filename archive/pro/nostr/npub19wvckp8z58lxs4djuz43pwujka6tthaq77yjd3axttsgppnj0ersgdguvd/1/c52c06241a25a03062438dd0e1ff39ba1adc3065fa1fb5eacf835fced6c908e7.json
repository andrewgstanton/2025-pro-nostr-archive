  "content": "Exactly 3 Weeks on Nostr 🧭\n\nExactly three weeks ago today I joined Nostr (joined May 4) and I started posting in earnest here. I didn’t know exactly what I was building — I just knew I was done waiting for permission.\n\nIn that time:\n\t•\t✅ Verified with Primal Premium\n\t•\t✍️ Completed a 5-part series: Why I Left Web3 for Proof of Work\n\t•\t🛠️ Pushed my first public GitHub repo (Nostr signal tools)\n\t•\t⚡ Posted daily (with signal > noise)\n\t•\t💰 Received 2,851 sats in zaps\n\t•\t🌐 Discovered GitHub Pages & self-hosting\n\t•\t🧱 Got the spark for Continuum, my social data sovereignty project\n\t•\t🎂 Turned 60\n\t•\t🤖 Got a huge boost from ChatGPT for writing, formatting, and ideation\n\nIt’s been a blur of building, pruning, and rediscovering purpose — with Bitcoin, with faith, with story. I’m not here to go viral. I’m here to leave a mark that lasts.\n\nTo those who’ve read, zapped, followed, replied — thank you.\nTo those still lurking — your time will come.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\nThis is why I’m here.\nThis is Proof of Work.\n\n🙏\n— Andrew\n\n#nostr #bitcoin #proofOfWork #sovereignstacker #buildWithoutPermission #nostrDev #zapLife #nostrMilestone #ChatGPT",
