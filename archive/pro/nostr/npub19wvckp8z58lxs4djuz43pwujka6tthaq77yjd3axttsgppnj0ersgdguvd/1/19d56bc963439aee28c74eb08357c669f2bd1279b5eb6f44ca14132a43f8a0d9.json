Around 2008, we joined the stream of costumed strangers crossing the city from Bay to breakers, laughing through the madness.\n\nSomewhere between the pink gorillas and rolling kegs, it stopped being just a race. It became a memory. A tradition. A thread in the fabric of my SF story.\n\nWatching it unfold again today, I’m reminded:\nThis city still pulses with life. You just have to keep moving with it.\n\nhttps://blossom.primal.net/f268066ce3773c1b686b204989b0d0c7bf887f016e46929f474fcd7220e0e2d5.png \n\n#BayToBreakers #SanFrancisco #StillHome #FamilyMiles #BitcoinInSF #ProofOfRun\n ",
