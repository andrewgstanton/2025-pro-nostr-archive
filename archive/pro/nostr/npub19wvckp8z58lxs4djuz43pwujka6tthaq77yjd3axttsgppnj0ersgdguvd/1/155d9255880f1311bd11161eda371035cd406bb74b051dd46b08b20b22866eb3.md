🍕 Road to Pizza Day: Feedback + 1,000 Sats Goal ⚡️

I’ve started sharing reflections, stories, and ideas here—just posted the first in a new series. More are coming.

If anything I post resonates, let me know. Feedback, reposts, questions, even gentle ( or not so gentle) disagreement—it all helps me grow and refine the signal.

As a small milestone, I’m setting a goal: 1,000 sats zapped to me (currently at 391– 1000  is not a lot about $1.00 currently ) by Bitcoin Pizza Day (May 22).

Not because I’m chasing tips, but because I want to know what’s connecting. Every zap is a signal. If you find value in what I share, zap away. If not, I’d still love your thoughts.

🧡 Thanks for walking this road with me. More coming soon.
