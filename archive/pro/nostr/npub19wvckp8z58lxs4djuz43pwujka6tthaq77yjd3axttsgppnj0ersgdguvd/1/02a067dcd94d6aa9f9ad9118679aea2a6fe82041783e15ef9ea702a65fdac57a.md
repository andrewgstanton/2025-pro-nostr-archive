⚡ Bitcoin Is Still the Signal — Even When the Noise Creeps In

At Bitcoin 2025, I felt a mix of deep conviction and subtle drift.

JD Vance mentioned “crypto” more than Bitcoin. Entrepreneurs pitched upcoming blockchain summits. Even Ross Ulbricht’s closing words on freedom—so raw and real—were bookended by a few moments that felt more like marketing.

Then I saw it again: a temporary XRP group inside CW3.  Turns out it was spun up just for the XRP Ledger Apex event in Singapore in a couple of weeks.  Smart branding, maybe. Strategic visibility.

But it made me realize—this is becoming a pattern. Create momentum, ride an event, move on.

It’s not always malicious. I suspect some leaders are trying to position CW3 and similar groups for stages at Consensus, TOKEN2049, etc. It’s understandable. But it’s not conviction.

And yet—here’s the paradox I’m learning to hold:

Even amid the hype, new Bitcoiners are born.

Governments, companies, and ordinary people are starting to see the long-term value. The event passes, the cameras fade, and someone goes home with a new sense of possibility.

Fifty years from now—probably a lot sooner—most of these “transformative” tokens and coins will vanish. Some will be exposed as outright scams. Others, like LTC and BCH, may limp along—but everything will be priced in BTC. The market forgets noise. It remembers truth.

That’s why I stay focused. Not to shout louder—but to keep building what endures.

Bitcoin is still the signal. And it keeps working—quietly, faithfully, in the background—long after the buzz dies down.
