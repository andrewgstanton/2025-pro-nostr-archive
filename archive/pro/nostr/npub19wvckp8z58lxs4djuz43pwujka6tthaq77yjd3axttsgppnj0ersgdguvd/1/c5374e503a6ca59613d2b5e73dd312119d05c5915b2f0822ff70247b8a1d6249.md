# Christmas Eve (Dec. 24, 2025) - Reflection IV — Faith, Technology, and Restraint

Christmas is not about power arriving all at once.
It’s about restraint — divinity choosing limitation.

That pattern shows up everywhere if you look:
in families
in money
in governance
in technology

Bitcoin Chronicles isn’t about domination or escape.
It’s about choosing structures that can bear moral weight without collapsing.

That’s a very old question, dressed in new clothes.
