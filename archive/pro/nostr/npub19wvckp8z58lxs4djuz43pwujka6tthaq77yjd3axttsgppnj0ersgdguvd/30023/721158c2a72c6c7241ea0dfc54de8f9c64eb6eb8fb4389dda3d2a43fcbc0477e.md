I used to think fidelity meant simply *staying*.  
Staying through the lean years, the arguments, the misunderstandings — the thousand little deaths that come from two wills trying to learn how to move as one. But twenty-five years in, I see it differently. Fidelity is not about holding still. It is about moving in the same direction when everything else is trying to scatter you.

When Kiyomi and I were young, love felt like a spark that could light anything. We mistook intensity for depth, the way new fire burns fast and bright. Over time, the spark learned patience. It learned the art of warmth — steady, quiet, sustaining. There were seasons when we wondered if the warmth would last. Bills piled, hopes stalled, parents aged, and the world shifted beneath our feet. But in every trial, something holy remained: the *decision* to remain in covenant.

Covenant is older than law. It is the first architecture of creation. “Let there be” was not a command shouted into chaos — it was a vow spoken into nothingness. God promised Himself to the world, and the world answered by becoming. Marriage, at its truest, is the same echo: two lives saying *let there be* to a shared story no one has seen yet.

Love has taken many forms for us — the daily coffee, the sigh before sleep, the gentle forgiveness that doesn’t need to be spoken. There were times I failed in presence, lost in the noise of ambition or fear. Yet each time I turned back, she was there, not as an ideal but as a living reminder that grace is not a theory. It breathes, it waits, it believes again.

We often tell ourselves that freedom is the absence of constraint. But I’ve learned that freedom is the fruit of fidelity. When you are bound by love, you are free to become who you were meant to be. The vow narrows the path so that purpose can widen within it. “He who loses his life shall find it” — that mystery has shaped not only our marriage but my understanding of creation itself. Continuum, the platform I’m building now, is in many ways a reflection of this truth: something enduring, sovereign, and bound by principle rather than popularity.

Our culture praises the new, the next, the uncommitted. But the long arc of fidelity is slow glory. It moves like a river carving stone, patient enough to form canyons. To stay — truly stay — is not weakness. It is the quiet rebellion of those who still believe in forever.

Tonight, as we mark a quarter century since we said yes, I feel no need for fireworks. Just gratitude. Gratitude for every mundane mercy — the meals, the shared laughter, the tiny rituals that built a cathedral of ordinary grace. Gratitude for the One who held us together when we could not hold ourselves. And gratitude for the story still unfolding, the one that will outlast our names, written in the language of love that never fails.

Faithfulness is not a finish line. It is a way of walking — step by step, year by year — until the vow becomes flesh.
