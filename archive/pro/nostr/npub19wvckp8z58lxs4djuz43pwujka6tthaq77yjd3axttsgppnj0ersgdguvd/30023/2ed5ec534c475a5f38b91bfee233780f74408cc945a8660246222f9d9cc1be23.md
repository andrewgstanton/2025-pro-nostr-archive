# **Don’t Trade One False Narrative for Another**

*A reflection for seekers, skeptics, and sovereign thinkers on Nostr*

***

### 🔓 1. The Courage to Question Is Good

Most of us came to Bitcoin — and maybe even to faith — because we questioned the stories we were told:

* That inflation is normal

* That government debt doesn’t matter

* That the mainstream always tells the truth

* That war is peace, and coercion is safety

So we left. We exited the matrix.\
That was good. That took courage.

***

### 🌪️ 2. But Questioning Can Become a Reflex

Once you see one lie, it’s tempting to believe everything is a lie:

* NASA is fake

* The Earth is flat

* Jews run everything

* Nothing is real

* Trust no one

But here’s the problem: **you can become just as enslaved** to *conspiracies* as you were to *institutions*.\
You’ve left one cage, only to build another.

### 🧭 3. Sovereignty Requires Discernment

Real sovereignty — the kind that Bitcoin models — is costly.\
You have to verify. Not just doubt.

It’s not enough to say “the mainstream is lying.”\
You have to *seek what’s true*, not just what’s hidden.\
You have to *build*, not just deconstruct.

***

### ⚖️ 4. Freedom Is Not License

There’s an element of **anarchy** in Bitcoin — and that’s not always a bad thing.\
Freedom does require rejecting illegitimate authority.\
But **freedom is not license**.

Sometimes the most **rebellious**, most **countercultural** thing you can do\
is not scream louder…\
but **repent from your sins**,\
**follow Jesus**,\
and **submit your will to what the Spirit says**.

That kind of surrender is more radical than any conspiracy theory.

### 📖 5. Where I Stand — Without Apology

Since I know this post will be misunderstood by some, let me be clear:

* ✅ I’m a **Christian Zionist**. I support Israel’s right to exist and defend itself.

* ✅ The Earth is **round**. It **revolves around the sun**. That’s not a psyop — it’s observable.

* ✅ The universe began with a **Big Bang** over **13 billion years ago**. That doesn’t conflict with faith — it deepens it.

* ✅ I am **anti-vax mandate**, but I am **not QAnon**.

* ✅ I am **not a white nationalist**, though I believe much of DEI and “wokeness” has gone too far.

* ✅ I am **strongly libertarian**.

* ✅ I am **anti-war** in principle, and I believe the U.S. should **stop acting as the world’s policeman**.

* ✅ I **do not hate anyone** — including those I disagree with.

* ✅ I **think climate change is real** — and always has been. Our planet has gone through many cycles of warming and cooling. I believe much of the hype around global warming being *purely* human-caused is up for honest debate.\
    That said: **just because I’m not a climate alarmist doesn’t mean I don’t care about the environment.** Stewardship matters. We are called to cultivate, not consume blindly.

* ✅ I **do not believe the Earth is overpopulated**. In fact, many places now face **net negative population growth**. We are always just **one generation away from extinction**. This is not a call for panic — it’s a call to love life, build families, and steward creation wisely.

I also want to say clearly:

\&gt; I **deeply respect** many voices in the Bitcoin space — like **Saifedean Ammous** and others — who would probably **strongly disagree with me** on some of these positions.\
\&gt; That’s okay. We can admire and learn from people even when we disagree, even **very strongly**, on certain issues.

That’s what mature sovereignty looks like.

### 🕊️ 6. Faith, Bitcoin, and the Narrow Road

Jesus said “the truth will set you free,”\
but He also said: *few find it.*

Truth isn’t whatever gets you banned.\
It’s not whatever shocks people.\
It’s not whatever makes you feel smarter than the crowd.

Truth has a pattern. It’s humble. It’s costly. It bears fruit.

***

### 🛠️ 7. I’m Still Unlearning, Too

I’ve believed lies. I’ve fallen for hype.\
But I keep returning to the question:

\&gt; “Is this true, or just countercultural?”\
\&gt; “Is this wisdom, or just rebellion in disguise?”

Bitcoin taught me to ask.\
Faith taught me to listen.\
The Spirit taught me to test.

***

### 💬 Final Thought

You don’t need to accept the mainstream story.\
But you also don’t need to accept every alternative one.

You’re allowed to walk slowly.\
To ask real questions.\
To love the truth more than the thrill.

Let’s be sovereign thinkers — not just louder ones.
