      "I will be running  a 6 part series called The Bitcoin Chronicles -- imagining what it would mean for Bitcoin to become not just a global reserve currency but an interplanetary (and ultimately an intergalactic one). The question is not just whether Bitcoin will endure on Earth — but whether it can carry sovereignty with us when humanity steps beyond Earth.  That is where The Bitcoin Chronicles begin."

  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - August 22, 2025\n\n## Part 1: Earthbound Origins\n\n- Bitcoin as the first neutral, sovereign money.\n- Why decentralization ≠ sovereignty, but sovereignty demands decentralization.\n- Earth as the “training ground” for resilience.\n\n## Part 2: Lunar Nodes\n\n- The Moon as Earth’s closest colony: ~1.3 second latency.\n- Lightning + local block explorers = workable circular economy.\n- How “first fruits” of sovereignty could be planted off-planet.\n\n## Part 3: Martian Bitcoin\n\n- Mars: 4–22 minutes delay → on-chain impractical for direct consensus.\n- Martian colonies must run semi-independent Bitcoin layers.\n- Sovereignty: Mars avoids becoming an Earth debt-colony by using Bitcoin.\n\n## Part 4: Asteroid Belt Economics\n\n- Mining asteroids = energy abundance (solar, nuclear, novel fuels).\n- Proof-of-Work literally scales with cosmic energy capture.\n- Colonies could “pay” each other with sats from asteroid resources.\n\n## Part 5: Interplanetary Consensus\n\n- No single “worldwide” mempool — instead, federations of local Bitcoin layers.\n- Lightning + delay-tolerant networking as the glue.\n- A future where humanity’s money works across planets because it’s grounded in physics, not politics.\n\n## Part 6: The Outer Edges\n\n- Beyond Mars: moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Oort Cloud, generation ships.\n- Even where latency breaks direct interaction, Bitcoin can remain the ledger of truth — time-stamped by thermodynamics, not Earthly decrees.",
