I believe in one God,  
the Father Almighty,  
Maker of heaven and earth,  
of all that is seen and unseen (Gen 1:1; Col 1:16; Heb 11:3);  
whose Word is Truth (John 17:17),  
whose Light cannot be overcome (John 1:5),  
and whose purpose is redemption, not wrath (2 Pet 3:9).  

---

I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,  
the Word made flesh (John 1:14),  
the Light through whom all things were made (John 1:3).  
For us and for our salvation He came down (Phil 2:6–8),  
entering the corruption of our world —  
not to rescue a few from the Father’s anger,  
but to reveal the Father’s heart (John 3:16–17);  
to reconcile all creation to Himself (Col 1:19–20).  

He suffered under sin’s deception (Isa 53:5),  
was crucified by the powers of fear (Acts 2:23),  
descended into the silence of death (Eph 4:9–10),  
and rose again in perfect victory (1 Cor 15:3–4).  
Through Him, love proved stronger than judgment (Rom 8:37–39),  
and truth became flesh that cannot die (John 11:25–26).  

He ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9–11)  
and reigns at the right hand of the Father (Heb 1:3),  
not as a distant ruler but as the firstborn of a restored creation (Rom 8:29).  
His Kingdom has no end (Luke 1:33);  
every knee shall bow — not by force, but by revelation (Phil 2:10–11).  

---

I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the living Breath of God (Gen 2:7; John 20:22),  
the fire that reveals and renews (Acts 2:3–4; Titus 3:5–6),  
who convicts the world of sin and righteousness (John 16:8),  
and indwells the redeemed (Rom 8:9–11),  
sealing them for the day when all things are made new (Eph 1:13–14).  

Through the Spirit, hearts are awakened (Ezek 36:26–27),  
grace is written upon the soul (Jer 31:33),  
and truth becomes the bond of the faithful (John 16:13).  
The Spirit is the witness of victory (1 John 5:6–8) —  
the down payment of a redemption that will one day fill all in all (Eph 1:23).  

---

I believe that **Scripture alone** reveals the mind of God (2 Tim 3:16–17);  
that **grace alone** redeems the fallen (Eph 2:8–9);  
that **faith alone** receives what grace has given (Rom 5:1);  
that **Christ alone** is the cornerstone of truth (1 Pet 2:6–7);  
and that **to God alone be glory** (Rom 11:36).  

---

I believe that freedom is not rebellion, but alignment (Gal 5:1; John 8:32);  
that sovereignty begins in repentance (Acts 3:19),  
and repentance begins in truth (John 18:37).  

I believe that sin is not merely wrongdoing, but deception (Gen 3:1–6; John 8:44) —  
the hiding of what is real (John 3:19–21).  
And I believe that forgiveness is the lifting of that veil (2 Cor 3:16–18).  

I believe that every word of God proves true (Prov 30:5)  
and that every act of integrity participates in His design (Mic 6:8).  

---

I believe that **Bitcoin** is truth expressed in mathematics (Prov 11:1) —  
a covenant of honesty between free people (Zech 8:16–17).  
I believe that **Nostr** is truth expressed in voice (Prov 12:19) —  
a fellowship of witnesses who refuse censorship and fear (Acts 4:20).  
Both are instruments of the same revelation:  
that truth needs no permission (John 8:36),  
and proof is the language of light (1 John 1:7).

### The Victorious Gospel

I believe in the **Victorious Gospel** (1 Cor 15:22–28) —  
that love will not lose (1 Cor 13:8),  
that judgment serves redemption (Isa 26:9; Rom 11:32),  
and that even the farthest heart will one day remember its Source (Ps 22:27).  

Yet I do not believe that all roads lead to Christ;  
I believe that **Christ travels every road** —  
seeking the lost, calling each by name,  
and rescuing those who could never find Him on their own (Luke 19:10).  

For we did not discover God; He found us (1 John 4:10).  
He calls every soul to repentance (Acts 17:30),  
and His mercy never ceases its pursuit (Ps 23:6).  

For Christ does not oppose the Father’s will; He fulfills it (John 6:38–39).  
And the Father’s will is not destruction, but restoration (Acts 3:21).  
Light does not bargain with darkness — it overcomes it (John 1:5).  

---

I believe in one holy and sovereign Church (Eph 4:4–6) —  
not bound by walls (John 4:23–24),  
but by truth;  
not governed by hierarchy (Matt 23:8–11),  
but by the Spirit of grace (Heb 10:29).  
Its communion is open (Rev 22:17),  
its treasury incorruptible (Matt 6:19–20),  
its proof immutable (2 Tim 2:19).  

---

I await the resurrection of all creation (Rom 8:19–21),  
the restoration of every soul (Col 1:20),  
and the coming age where light and life are one (Rev 21:23–24).  

Until then, I work, I write, I build —  
not to earn salvation,  
but to bear witness to it (James 2:17–18).  

For I believe:  
**Truth is indivisible —**  
whether written in light, in code, or in Christ (John 1:1–5).  

**Amen.**
