Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 26, 2025

In the year 2120, the people of Mars celebrated a Thanksgiving unlike any before it.  
Not because the food was different — though it was.  
Not because the communities were spread across multiple worlds — though they were.  
But because, for the first time in human history, *sovereign peoples across the Solar Frontier consciously aligned their gratitude into a single shared rhythm.*

This was the first Thanksgiving after the **United Earth Bureau Incident**, the final failed attempt by Earth’s central authority to override Martian self-governance. When Earth tried to nullify the Mars-wide referendum on independence, the colonies did not respond with rebellion. They responded with *unity*.

That unity became known as the **Sovereign Network** — a constellation of independent communities tied not by treaties or constitutions, but by ethos, memory, and voluntary alignment.

And on this 500th anniversary of the Mayflower, that unity became visible in light.

## **The Beacon of Worlds**

At sunset over the Tharsis plains, New Lakota lit the first beacon — a thin golden beam that rose from the Plains Dome and arced across the sky. Minutes later, another beam rose from New Bern’s alpine terraces, cutting clean through the thin Martian atmosphere.

From Aurelius Crater to the Bastion Settlements, from Luna Freeport’s docks to the outer Belt Stations, the sky filled with hundreds of synchronized lights.

It was not a commemoration of Earth.  
It was not a rejection of Earth.  
It was a *reminder* of what the Mayflower symbolized long before nationalism claimed it:

**The human willingness to cross great distances  
to live free of imposed authority.**

Thanksgiving, across the Sovereign Network, is a remembrance that freedom is not an entitlement but a journey — a journey repeated on Mars, on Luna, in the Belt, and in every sovereign enclave that chose self-determination over security offered by distant powers.

## **New Lakota: Plains of Remembrance**

For New Lakota, Thanksgiving is grounded in the memory of peoples who had once been displaced, divided, and domesticated under Earth’s historical systems of control. The founders of New Lakota came from Earth sovereign movements such as Hilo, Puerto Esperanza, and El Dorado. They carried ancestral wisdom that sovereignty, to be real, must never depend on the permission of power.

In New Lakota, the morning begins with the **Silent Crossing**: an hour with no speech, acknowledging the courage of those who crossed oceans, then atmospheres, then worlds.

Children trace their hands across Martian soil — red, iron-rich, untamed.  
Not as a gesture of ownership, but of *stewardship*.  
The soil is not conquered. It is cared for.

## **New Bern: Alpine Democracy Reborn**

In New Bern, Thanksgiving brings the community to the terraces overlooking the Vallis Schiaparelli canyons. The settlement is built in tiers, each representing a layer of democratic participation — from the individual to the family circle, to the canton, to the voluntary alliances beyond.

The people gather to read the **Banned Votes** — the tallies the UEB attempted to erase. Every year, the numbers are spoken with solemn gratitude:

- Because they represent consent.  
- Because they represent memory.  
- Because they represent a world where power no longer overrides the will of communities.

New Bern’s Thanksgiving feast is a blend of alpine and Martian traditions:  
heritage grains from Luna Freeport, hydroponic greens from the Plains Network, engineered proteins seasoned with Earth spices carried across generations.

## **Luna Freeport & the Belt**

Luna Freeport celebrates at midday Earth-time, symbolically recognizing its position as the “gateway sovereignty.” Their feast is modest but symbolic — the food is less important than the message: **“We stand with Mars, not over it.”**

In the Belt stations, Thanksgiving is more of an alignment ritual. They observe a tradition called **The Third Orbit**, in which free-floating stations align their rotation cycles with Mars for one lunar hour. It’s a reminder that even in harsh, decentralized environments, there can be unity without governance.

## **A New Kind of Thanksgiving**

Thanksgiving in the Sovereign Network is less about food and more about *memory*. Not nostalgia, but continuity. Not heritage, but trajectory.

The Mayflower’s 500th anniversary is a reminder that:

- Sovereignty is chosen.  
- Freedom is defended.  
- Community is voluntary.  
- Identity is self-owned.  
- The frontier is not a place, but a posture.

On this Thanksgiving, under the thin Martian sky, the people of the Sovereign Network gave thanks not for what they had, but for what they no longer feared losing.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.

## Zaps Appreciated
If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.
