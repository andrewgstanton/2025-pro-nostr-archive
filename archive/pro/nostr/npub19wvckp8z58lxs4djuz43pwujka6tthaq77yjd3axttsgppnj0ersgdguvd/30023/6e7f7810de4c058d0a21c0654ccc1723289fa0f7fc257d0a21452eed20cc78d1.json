  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Aug. 31, 2025\n\nFive hundred years from now, what will remain of the digital projects built in our time? History suggests the answer: only those rooted in truth, patience, and sacrifice.\n\nEmpires have risen and fallen on Earth for millennia. Some left monuments, others left ruins. The difference was not size or speed, but what they were built upon.\n\n## The Short Horizon of Web3\n\nWeb3 projects promise permanence. They call themselves “decentralized,” “unstoppable,” “future-proof.” But their incentives betray them. They are not built for centuries. They are built for speculation.\n\nTokens are launched not to sustain a community for generations, but to capture attention and capital in the moment. Developers move on when the hype fades. Users are left holding empty bags. Entire “ecosystems” vanish in a single bear market.\n\nLike sandcastles, Web3 empires rise quickly and wash away just as fast.\n\n## The Patience of Cathedrals\n\nContrast this with the Cathedral on Mars. Five hundred years from now, it still stands because it was built on covenant, not speculation. Its treasury is incorruptible, its funding transparent, its purpose intergenerational.\n\nEach stone was placed knowing it might not be completed for centuries. Each satoshi contributed was given not for quick return, but for continuity. That is why it endures.\n\nThis is the logic of cathedrals: permanence requires patience. It requires builders willing to sacrifice immediate gain for future generations. It requires foundations that do not decay.\n\n## Web3 Cannot Simulate Sacrifice\n\nWeb3 can imitate permanence with marketing slogans, but it cannot embody it. It rewards those who exit quickly, not those who build slowly. It celebrates speculation, not stewardship.\n\nA true cathedral is never built on speculation. It is built on truth, on the willingness to give without expecting return, on the conviction that some things are worth carrying forward even if we never see their completion.\n\nBitcoin reflects that cathedral logic. Web3 does not. That is why, in 500 years, the monuments of Web3 will be forgotten footnotes, while Bitcoin — like the cathedrals of old — will still stand.\n\n## What Endures\n\nWhen pilgrims walk through the Cathedral on Mars in the year 2525, they will see the handprints of generations who built for permanence. They will not see the ruins of speculative projects, because those projects leave no enduring mark.\n\nThe difference is simple. Web3 builds for hype. Bitcoin builds for history.\n\nIn the end, only what is built on truth will endure five centuries — or forever.\n\n--- \n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C - ChatGPT (GPT-5), which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology\n\n\n--- \n\n## Zaps Appreciated\n\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers, just direct proof that this work matters. It helps me keep building Continuum and writing about sovereign technology, freely and without VC overhead. Thank you.\n\nYou can send zaps to my lightning address here : andrewgstanton​​​@primal.net",
