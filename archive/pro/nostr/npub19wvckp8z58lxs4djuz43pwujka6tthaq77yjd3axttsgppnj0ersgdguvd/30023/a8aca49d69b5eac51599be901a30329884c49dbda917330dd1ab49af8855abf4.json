  "content": "Most people think a username is an identity. It’s not — it’s a lease.\n\n- On Twitter, you’re a tenant.\n- On LinkedIn, you’re a tenant.\n- On YouTube, you’re a tenant.\n\nIf the landlord doesn’t like you, your “identity” disappears.\n\nAn **npub** is different: it’s math, not permission. It’s yours even if every relay but one shuts down.\n\nIn the full article, I share:\n\n- Why usernames are costumes, not roots\n- How npubs function as sovereign passports\n- Why custody, identity, and exit apply to people as much as money\n\n🔒 **Full article available for 500 sats.** Zap me and I’ll send it via encrypted DM while I finish building the automated unlock flow in Continuum.",
