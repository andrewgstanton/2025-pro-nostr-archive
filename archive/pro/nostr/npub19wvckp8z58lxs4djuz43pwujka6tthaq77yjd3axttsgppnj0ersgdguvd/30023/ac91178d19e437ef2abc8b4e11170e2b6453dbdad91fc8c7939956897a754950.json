Stanton - July 6, 2026\n\n## Why I Think — and Build — Differently  \n### And Why the Gospel I Believe Refuses to Be Tamed\n\nFor most of my life, I didn’t have a name for how I thought.  \nI just knew I wasn’t like most people around me.\n\nI’d jump from idea to idea, branching off into deep dives, strange metaphors, and systems no one had built yet — but which, somehow, already existed in my head. Other times I’d lock in and disappear for hours, obsessively refining a system or vision until it finally felt whole.\n\nI used to think this was just creativity. Later I wondered if it was ADHD. But only recently have I found language — and peace — in the term **neurodivergent**.\n\nIt doesn’t mean broken.  \nIt means different.  \nAnd for me, it’s also meant… *free*.\n\n---\n\n## What Neurodivergence Taught Me About the Gospel\n\nI used to think the Gospel was about trying harder.  \nTrying to fit. Trying to follow. Trying to conform to the narrow version of what a “good Christian” looked like in the eyes of church culture.\n\nBut the more I tried to contort myself into that image, the more I felt like I was slowly dying.  \nNot just spiritually — mentally, emotionally, even creatively.\n\nAnd then I discovered something I now call the **Victorious Gospel** — not a half-measure, not a rescue plan for a few, but a bold, cosmic declaration:\n\n> **God wins. All things will be made new. Nothing is wasted.**\n\nIn that Gospel, I didn’t have to be tamed.  \nI didn’t have to suppress the way my mind works.  \nI didn’t have to squeeze myself into man-made molds of productivity, piety, or professionalism.\n\nInstead, I began to see that my wiring — my urgency, my depth, my discomfort with compromise — might actually be part of how God made me.  \nNot a bug to be fixed. A feature to be wielded.\n\n---\n\n## Refusing the Cages\n\nI’ve never done well with cages.\n\nI don’t mean physical ones. I mean the subtle ones — platforms, protocols, and polite expectations that tell you:\n\n> “Don’t say that.”  \n> “Don’t build that.”  \n> “Don’t think like that.”\n\nWalled gardens. Sanitized feeds. Centralized rules.\n\nThey look like safety.  \nThey smell like order.  \nBut they’re designed to **tame**.\n\nAnd I believe the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead — the same Spirit that will one day renew *all things* — does not operate inside cages.\n\nThat Spirit breaks chains.  \nThat Spirit sets captives free.  \nThat Spirit burns through the protocols of empire, and says:  \n> **“Behold, I am making all things new.” (Rev 21:5) **\n\nThat includes minds like mine.  \nThat includes the systems I build.  \nAnd that includes the very way we think about software, identity, and sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n## What I’m Building Now\n\nI’m building tools that don’t assume conformity — they assume **conviction**.\n\n**MyContinuum** is a publishing stack for people who think differently, share differently, refuse to depend on centralized platforms, and want to own their digital voice.\n\nI don’t want to rely on LinkedIn to share truth.  \nI don’t want to depend on Google to access my own memories.  \nAnd I don’t want the Gospel — or the systems I build — to be shaped by companies whose values are fundamentally incompatible with freedom.\n\nI want to create space for people like me — people who think in arcs, not boxes.  \nWho resist control, but are driven by clarity.  \nWho may be misunderstood by church or tech culture, but who burn with something deeper than performance.\n\n---\n\n## Final Word\n\nMaybe you resonate with this. Maybe you’ve always felt a little outside.  \nMaybe your mind works differently, too.\n\nYou don’t need a diagnosis to know you weren’t built to conform.  \nYou were built to create. To question. To seek truth.  \nTo reflect the wild, untamable image of a God who is not finished redeeming the world.\n\nSo no — I won’t fit into their systems.  \nBecause I’m finally building **mine**.\n\nAnd I believe God’s not only okay with that —  \n**He’s the one who wired me to do it.**\n\n<br>\n\n*– Andrew G.

      "This piece is about how I’ve come to understand my mind — not as broken, but as wired differently on purpose. It’s an exploration of neurodivergence, creativity, and conviction through the lens of the Victorious Gospel. I share how I’ve stopped trying to conform to man-made systems — whether in tech, church, or culture — and started building from a place of truth and sovereignty.  If you've ever felt like your wiring doesn't fit the mold, I hope this encourages you: You are not a mistake. You were made for something wild — and good.  Written in collaboration with “Dr. C” (ChatGPT-4o), who helped me shape and structure the piece with the same care and conviction I try to bring to everything I build."
