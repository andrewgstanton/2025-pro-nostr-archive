The Shackleton Accords created a framework.  
The Free Launch Era created the culture.  
But without something to bind decisions across enclaves, Luna risked fracturing.

What emerged was not a legislature.  
Not a court.  
Not even a council.

It was something the settlers called:

> **The Shackleton Circle.**

A governance ritual, not a government.

---

## **I. The First Circle**
The first Circle wasn’t planned.

A dispute broke out between:

- the Regolith Works Cooperative  
- and the Algae Gardeners Guild  

over access rights to a coolant loop channel shared between their habitats.

The official UEB protocol would have required:

- environmental inspectors  
- engineering audits  
- external arbitration  
- a three-week wait  
- and a compliance fee

The settlers refused.

Instead, twelve representatives sat in a literal circle on the dust floor of Corridor J-3.  
They explained their positions.  
They negotiated.  
They reached a compromise.

Then they did something more surprising:

They wrote down the process.

Not the decision.  
The *process*.

## **II. The Principles of Circle Law**
The Shackleton Circle eventually codified seven principles:

1. **Anyone may speak.**  
   Expertise matters, but hierarchy does not.

2. **Decisions must be reversible.**  
   No binding law can exceed the lifespan of a dome without review.

3. **Consensus over coercion.**  
   A decision that alienates a guild is not a decision.

4. **Bitcoin as final arbiter.**  
   Settlement must be signed. If unsigned, it never happened.

5. **Guild autonomy first.**  
   Luna is built by guilds, not governments.

6. **Transparency is mandatory.**  
   Any decision affecting multiple guilds must be published in a public Merkle log.

7. **Circles must dissolve after the decision.**  
   No permanent councils. No career politicians.

Circle Law became the backbone of lunar governance.

---

## **III. How Circles Spread**
The idea resonated immediately.

- Mining guilds used Circles for land-allocation disputes.  
- Terraformers for resource budgeting.  
- Lunar Scribes for archival consistency.  
- Energy Cooperatives for reactor maintenance rotation.  

Earth-based governance seemed absurd in comparison.

The settlers joked:

> “Circles make simple things simple again.”

Within a year, the Shackleton Circle had replaced all Earth-derived legal structures in sovereign enclaves.

---

## **IV. Influence on Freeport**
When Luna Freeport emerged as neutral ground, it adopted Circle Law by necessity.

Freeport had:

- no police  
- no central government  
- no external authority  

Circle Law worked because it didn’t require any.

Archivists later wrote:

> “Freeport was governed not by rulers,  
> but by circles that dissolved before they could become rulers.”

This ethic defined the entire lunar diaspora.

---

## **V. Legacy**
The Shackleton Circle became:

- the precursor to the Pelagia Compact  
- a foundational principle of sovereign jurisprudence  
- the first legal system built entirely on voluntary association  
- a model that Mars later adopted

Centuries later, Martian legal scholars would call Circle Law:

> **“the most elegant governance system ever designed — because it refuses to become a system.”**
