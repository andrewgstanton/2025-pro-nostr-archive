There’s an elephant standing in the middle of nearly every faith-driven business gathering. It’s polite, patient, and completely invisible. Everyone talks about generosity, impact, and transformation — but no one mentions that the entire system runs on **debased currency.**

We speak of stewardship while building on sand.  
We host panels on ethics while measuring success in inflated dollars.  We praise sustainability while quietly relying on a monetary architecture that extracts from the poor to enrich the first receivers of new credit.  The contradiction isn’t personal; it’s structural.

Jesus once said,  
> “No one can serve two masters… You cannot serve God and money.”  
> *(Matthew 6:24)*  

Most of us assume He meant greed or idolatry. But the line also speaks to integrity. You can’t build a Kingdom economy on a foundation of counterfeit promises. You can’t preach honesty in transactions while your ledger lies for a living.

The inflation system is the quietest theft in history.  It punishes savers, rewards debtors, and teaches whole cultures to live beyond their means.  And yet churches and Christian investors rarely name it, because to do so would expose their dependence on it.  The house of faith rests on a monetary Babel.

That silence is the real scandal.  
It’s not that people are hypocrites — it’s that they’ve never been shown another way.  The whole structure seems natural, inevitable.  Inflation is treated like weather: inconvenient but unstoppable.

Bitcoin disrupts that fatalism.  
It shows that money can be finite, transparent, and voluntary again.  It restores the moral link between labor and value.  You can measure stewardship honestly only when the measure itself is honest.

This is the challenge for the next generation of faith-driven builders:  
Will we keep baptizing the old system, or will we start building a new one?  
Will we keep our slogans, or will we keep our word?

The prophet Amos once thundered,  

> “Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.”  
> *(Amos 5:24)*  

That river begins with honest scales.  
Sound money is the first justice reform.

The elephant under the altar is still there, waiting to be acknowledged.  
The moment we speak its name, worship becomes truthful again.
