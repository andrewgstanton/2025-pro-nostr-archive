  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 16, 2025\n\nChains are rarely visible. In the modern world, they take the form of digits on a screen. The monthly balance. The minimum payment. The credit score that rises and falls like a mood ring.\n\nCredit is not freedom. It is leverage. And leverage always cuts both ways. For the lender, it is power. For the borrower, it is a leash.\n\nI have felt the tug of that leash more times than I would like to admit. A card payment due, a reminder that part of my income is already spoken for. Every “point earned” is really a shackle disguised as a perk. The airline miles, the cash-back percentages — all are bait, designed to keep the borrower chained to a cycle of spending, repaying, and spending again.\n\nThe danger is not just the interest rates or the fees. The deeper danger is the illusion that the credit line is “yours.” It is not. It belongs to the lender, and it can be reduced, frozen, or revoked at their discretion. That chain is not only invisible, it is adjustable.\n\nConsider a typical scenario. A bank sends you an offer for a new credit card: a $10,000 limit, with 0% interest on balance transfers for 15 months. It sounds like a lifeline. You transfer $6,000 from another high-interest card. That puts you at 60% utilization on this new card. You pay the 3% transfer fee up front — $180 — but it feels worth it, because you’ll avoid hundreds or even thousands in interest over the coming year.\n\nYou play the game well. You make your minimum payments on time. You even chip away at the principal, because the promotional period means every dollar goes toward reducing the balance. For twelve months, all is going according to plan.\n\nAnd then the chain tightens. The issuer reviews your profile, perhaps noticing that your overall debt is still high. Quietly, without your consent, they reduce your limit from $10,000 to $6,500. Suddenly, you are no longer at 60% utilization. You are at 92% — on a card barely a year old. Your credit score drops. The system flags you as “high risk.” And now, when you try to transfer that balance again to keep the 0% gravy train going, no other bank wants to take the risk.\n\nWhat felt like a tool for freedom becomes another trap. The rules were never yours to control. The game was always theirs. And here is an even harsher truth: once a limit is reduced, it is notoriously difficult to raise it again. Banks are far quicker to cut than to restore. In fact, it is often easier to apply for an entirely new card with a higher limit than to convince a lender to reinstate the one they lowered. The chain, once shortened, rarely lengthens.\n\nThis is why credit is a chain. Because it can change without warning, leaving you vulnerable in a moment. Your apparent access to $10,000 was never real. It was conditional. And conditions change.\n\nThe sovereign path is to recognize this fragility and to refuse to build your life on it. That does not mean rejecting credit entirely — sometimes it can be used strategically — but it does mean seeing it clearly. A chain is still a chain, no matter how polished the links.\n\nBreaking free requires more than paying off balances. It requires a new relationship with money. A commitment to spend only what one has. A recognition that true wealth is not measured in available credit but in unencumbered assets.\n\nThis is not an easy mindset shift. The culture around us encourages dependency. Entire industries profit from people living on borrowed money. Credit scores are treated as measures of responsibility, when in reality they are measures of profitability — how much money lenders can make from you. A “good” credit score does not mean you are financially free. It means you are profitable to the system.\n\nAnd here I must confess: I don’t write this as someone untouched by the game. I’ve transferred balances more than once, and under certain circumstances I might do it again. The temptation is real, and sometimes the math looks too good to ignore. But here is the difference: I no longer confuse these maneuvers with freedom. They are tactical moves in a system designed to profit from me, not pathways to sovereignty. Sovereignty begins not when you stop playing, but when you stop being fooled about the nature of the game.\n\nThat honesty matters. Because the system thrives on self-deception — the belief that if you play cleverly enough, you can outsmart it. For a season, you might. But the chains remain. The only real freedom comes when you hold wealth that no one can take, reduce, or reprice without your consent.\n\nI have walked both roads — the road of chasing promotional offers, and the road of painfully paying balances down with real cash flow. The first road feels clever for a season, but it ends in a trap. The second feels brutal at first, but it ends in freedom.\n\nThe lesson is simple: credit is not yours. It never was. The bank can take it away the moment it serves their interest. And once taken, it is rarely restored. The only wealth that is truly yours is the wealth you hold outright, without conditions.\n\nCredit as a chain is powerful because it is invisible. Freedom comes when you finally hear the clink, and decide to step away.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
