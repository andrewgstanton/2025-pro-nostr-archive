  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - August 24, 2025\n\nA lot of people equate sovereign with decentralized. They’re not the same.\n\n- **Decentralized** means the system isn’t controlled by a single party.\n- **Sovereign** means you aren’t controlled by the system.\n\nYou can be in a decentralized network and still lack sovereignty — if your keys, identity, or livelihood depend on someone else’s rules, you’re still captive.\n\nIn the full article, I break down:\n\n- Why decentralization alone isn’t enough to guarantee freedom\n- How “distributed fragility” (gig work, Web3 platforms, federated networks) mimics sovereignty but isn’t\n- The three irreducible marks of sovereignty: custody, identity, and exit\n\n----\n\n🔒 **Full article available for 500 sats**.
