Andrew G. Stanton - August 25, 2025

Fiat thinking is subtle, but it poisons every decision. Here are three dangers I’ve learned to watch for:

1. Moving goalposts.
In dollars, “enough” is never enough. Inflation shifts the target every year. What looked like freedom in 2015 feels inadequate in 2025. You keep chasing a number that keeps moving.

2. Endless chase.
When your scoreboard is fiat, you never step off the treadmill. You can be up 50% this year and still feel behind, because the unit itself is melting.

3. Short-term bias.
Fiat blinds you to compounding. Traders obsess over nominal gains this week, instead of stacking assets that hold value across decades.

Bitcoin fixes this by giving us a scoreboard that doesn’t melt. Measured in sats, your progress is stable. You can set goals that hold their meaning.

That shift — from fiat thinking to Bitcoin thinking — changes how you save, trade, and even design your income. It’s the difference between fragility and sovereignty.

## Zaps Appreciated

If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers, just direct proof that this work matters. It helps me keep building Continuum and writing about sovereign technology, freely and without VC overhead. Thank you.
