While Earth still fought over bandwidth taxes and censorship algorithms, the Belt prepared to speak to the stars.

Quantum communication had long been theory; entanglement decayed too quickly over distance. Then a Ceres research collective discovered a stable lattice of super-cooled diamond threaded with muon-doped graphene. Two such lattices could remain phase-locked indefinitely — even when one was flung toward Alpha Centauri on a fusion sail.

They called the system EntBridge-1.
Each pair of lattices served as a single clock — not metaphorically, but literally. When a Bitcoin block was mined in the Belt, its hash echoed instantly in the sister lattice 4.24 light-years away.

It was the end of light-lag consensus.
The beginning of interstellar simultaneity.

Earth’s governments dismissed it as fantasy. Their economists worried more about GDP than about gravity. But the Belt understood the implications: truth itself could now traverse the void without intermediaries.

When the first bridge came online, engineers wept. A psalm recorded in a miner’s chapel on Vesta played instantaneously in the Centauri receiver — no delay, no error. For a moment, two star systems shared a single heartbeat.

The Belt hailed this as the completion of the “Third Reformation”:

The first had freed conscience from priests.

The second had freed money from banks.

The third would free truth from time.

On Earth, reaction was mixed. Media cartels demanded regulation; theologians argued over whether instantaneous transmission mocked the divine. Yet even they could not deny that something sacred had occurred: distance itself had been made honest.

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
