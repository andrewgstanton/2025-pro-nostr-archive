Stanton - Oct. 11, 2025\n\nThere are seasons when writing feels like bleeding in public.\nYou want to hide until the wound closes, but the only way you know how to heal is through words. So you keep showing up at the page, rearranging pain into paragraphs, trusting that meaning might emerge.\n\nWhen I sit to write in those times, I’m not chasing eloquence. I’m searching for bearings. The act of putting language to what I feel is less about publishing and more about staying whole. Words don’t erase ache, but they keep it from dissolving into chaos.\n\nThere’s a difference between confession and performance. Confession is a candle; performance is a spotlight. When the heart is rearranging itself, light must be gentle. I try to write as if I’m speaking to a single friend in the next room—someone who won’t flinch at the silence between sentences.\n\nIn this way, grief teaches a writer restraint. I used to fill every pause with explanation, afraid readers would misunderstand. But in sorrow, I learned that honesty needs space. Not everything must be justified; some truths only breathe when you stop defending them.\n\nIt’s tempting to use writing as escape—turn pain into art quickly so you don’t have to feel it raw. But when you rush, the work becomes brittle. Grief moves at its own pace, slower than syntax, indifferent to deadlines. The best thing you can do is align with its tempo. Let it edit you before you edit it.\n\nThere are days when even that feels impossible. The cursor blinks like a pulse you can’t match. On those days, I shrink the goal. One true line is enough. “I miss him.” “I’m still here.” “The world feels heavier.” Each sentence a small act of defiance against numbness.\n\nPeople sometimes praise vulnerability as courage, but I think it’s closer to necessity. Writing in public through grief isn’t about bravery; it’s about survival. You share not to impress, but to stay connected to reality. Pain isolates. Expression bridges.\n\nWhat helps is remembering that readers carry their own invisible losses. When you speak from the fracture, you’re never truly alone. Others hear the tremor and recognize their own. That’s the hidden mercy of communal honesty—it turns mourning into fellowship.\n\nStill, there’s danger in overexposure. Not everything belongs to the public square. Some memories need to stay sheltered until they ripen into wisdom. I keep a private journal for what isn’t ready, and Continuum for what is. The distinction keeps both spaces sacred.\n\nOver time, something unexpected happens: the voice that trembled grows steadier. The same experiences that once unmade you become part of your grammar. You start noticing beauty again—how light falls on old papers, how coffee steam curls like prayer. Writing didn’t fix you, but it trained your eyes to see resurrection traces everywhere.\n\nGrief changes the writer’s contract with truth. You stop reaching for perfect metaphors and settle for honest ones. You accept that clarity might look like broken glass: sharp, scattered, reflecting light unevenly. That’s fine. Readers don’t need polish; they need presence.\n\nI often return to the first stories ever told—Psalms, laments, letters from exile. None of them flinch from darkness, yet all of them aim toward light. They remind me that the sacred library of humanity was written by people who cried while writing. The holiness wasn’t in their composure; it was in their refusal to lie about pain.\n\nWhen I publish in these seasons, I worry less about audience reaction. Whether someone praises or scrolls past isn’t the point. What matters is that the words stand as markers: I was here, and I told the truth. That’s all writing ever promises.\n\nEventually, the ache dulls. The sharp edges of memory soften into shape. Then you read what you wrote and realize it carried you through. The page became a companion, steady when nothing else was.\n\nThat’s what I mean by grief in public—not spectacle, but witness. The courage to let your humanity stay visible while it heals. Because when one person keeps writing through sorrow, it gives others permission to keep living through theirs.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
