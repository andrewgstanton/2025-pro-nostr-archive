Readers of the Sovereign Archive will observe an apparent inconsistency in temporal notation across the Chronicles.

This inconsistency is intentional.

After the Pilgrim era, humanity no longer shared a single conception of time.

Earth-based administrative institutions — including the United Earth Bureau (UEB) and its subsidiary agencies — continued to operate using Gregorian calendar dates and Coordinated Universal Time. These systems persisted not because they were superior, but because they were legible to bureaucracy. Reports, incident logs, compliance filings, and regulatory directives required timestamps that could be audited, compared, and enforced by centralized authority.

Gregorian time became the language of administration.

Sovereign settlements, by contrast, abandoned calendar-based time as a primary reference. Lunar Freeport, Martian charters, Belt guilds, and later civilizations adopted ledger-relative systems: block height, transaction epochs, covenant cycles, or consensus timestamps derived from distributed validation.

Ledger time could not be issued, revised, or backdated by decree.  
It could only be proven.

As a result, two temporal regimes coexisted:

Administrative Time — linear, calendar-based, authority-validated.  
Sovereign Time — relational, ledger-based, consensus-verified.

In transitional records, the same event may appear twice: once marked by Gregorian date in Earth-based reports, and once indexed by block height or epoch within sovereign archives. Where both appear, the discrepancy itself often signals contested authority.

Archivists retain both systems when preserving records, not to reconcile them, but to reveal their underlying assumptions.

Gregorian timestamps indicate who claimed jurisdiction.  
Ledger timestamps indicate where truth was anchored.

Time, like money, follows the structure of power.  
When power decentralizes, time does not disappear — it becomes sovereign.
