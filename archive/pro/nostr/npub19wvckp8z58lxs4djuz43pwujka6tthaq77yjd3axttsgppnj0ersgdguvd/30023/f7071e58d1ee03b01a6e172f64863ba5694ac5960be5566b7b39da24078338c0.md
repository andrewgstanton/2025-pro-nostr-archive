Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 27, 2025

When a loved one stands at the edge of eternity, the world grows unbearably still.
Every sound feels sacred — the rhythm of breathing, the rustle of blankets, the clock that no longer measures progress but mercy.

Sabbath became that for me: not a scheduled rest, but a sacred pause where nothing needed to be fixed, solved, or hurried. We were simply present — listening for what cannot be said in words. The room held a holy hush, the kind Scripture describes when the Lord “is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence.”

There are moments when heaven feels almost visible — not as a place beyond but as a presence near. In that quiet, I stopped praying for healing and began praying for peace. My father’s breathing slowed, and something within me slowed with it. It was as though the whole cosmos was teaching me the meaning of rest — not as idleness, but as surrender.

The Sabbath is not the end of work but its fulfillment. In that stillness I sensed creation itself sighing in rhythm with him, as though all of time were bending gently to make room for grace.

Sometimes the greatest faith is not found in action but in stillness — in the trust that God is completing what we cannot. The night before departure is the longest night, but also the holiest. For in its silence, love holds watch — and eternity draws near.
