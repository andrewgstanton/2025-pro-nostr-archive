**Andrew G. Stanton — Sunday Reflection (October 19, 2025)**  

The words we choose for God shape the kind of faith we live.  
Every language has a theology hidden in its grammar.  
Nouns fix, verbs move, and prepositions tell us where we stand in relation to everything else.  
Grace, too, has a grammar — and for much of our history, we’ve conjugated it in the wrong tense.  

We’ve spoken of grace as something *given*, *earned*, or *owed* — as if it were a noun that could be passed like currency.  
But the earliest followers of Christ spoke of it as a *verb*: to share, to dwell, to become.  
Grace was participation, not possession.  
It wasn’t what you had; it was what you joined.

## 1. The Shift from Gift to Grammar  
In the language of empire, grace became a unit of transaction.  
It was counted, mediated, distributed.  
The Church became an institution of grammar — deciding who could use the word and in what case.  
But in the older tongues of faith, grace was never a system.  
It was breath.  
It happened when people lived truthfully enough that divine life could pass through them.  

You can see it in the verbs of Scripture: *abide, become, give, forgive, dwell, rest*.  
Each describes motion, not ownership.  
The grammar of grace is always relational — *with*, *in*, *through*.  
It depends on prepositions more than pronouns.

## 2. The Lost Conjugations  
Somewhere between Latin and law, we changed tenses.  
Grace moved from the present continuous — *is saving* — to the past perfect — *has saved*.  
From process to product.  
From living relationship to closed account.  

The early mystics resisted that collapse.  
Julian of Norwich, writing in the shadow of plague, said it simply: “The love of God is without beginning.”  
In her grammar, grace could never be finished.  
It was not a completed favor but an ongoing pulse — a verb that refused to sit still.  

If we spoke this way again, maybe faith would sound less like a courtroom and more like a song.

## 3. The Language of the Heart  
Linguists say that every sentence reveals a worldview.  
Maybe theology should be read the same way.  
When we say *I found God*, we make ourselves the subject, the seeker, the agent.  
When we say *God found me*, the subject changes — we become object, received, beloved.  
The grammar itself teaches humility.  

That’s why translation is holy work.  
It’s not just about words; it’s about recovering relationships.  
To translate grace back into motion is to restore the heart’s native language.

## 4. Grace in Code  
When I write code, I notice that syntax determines meaning.  
A misplaced bracket can collapse an entire program.  
Language, in every form, demands alignment.  

Maybe grace is like that — divine syntax correcting the broken loops of our will.  
Sin is recursion without resolution; grace is the interpreter that halts the error and re-runs the function in love.  
It’s not the suspension of consequence but the repair of connection.  

The grammar of grace isn’t sentimental.  
It’s structural — a logic of belonging written into creation itself.  
Everything that lives depends on it: the light abiding in darkness, the breath returning after silence, the seed breaking open to become what it already was.

## 5. Speaking the Word Again  
Each age has to relearn how to say grace.  
Our modern tongue, trained by markets, defaults to the language of exchange: input, output, profit, loss.  
But grace operates outside that syntax.  
It’s the unquantifiable surplus that keeps the world from collapsing into efficiency.  

To speak grace today is to resist the algorithmic grammar of the age — to reintroduce words that refuse commodification: *mercy, patience, presence, forgiveness.*  
These are not metrics; they are relationships.  

The Church of the first thousand years knew this instinctively.  
Their prayers were songs, not spreadsheets.  
Their worship began not with confession of guilt but with invocation of light.  
They sang what they couldn’t explain.  
That’s how language stays alive.

## 6. Grace as Participation  
If we rewrote the creed for this century, it might start here:  
> “We believe in grace, not as a transaction to receive, but a life to join.”  

Grace is not a pardon slip.  
It’s a current — divine energy flowing through human lives, gathering fragments back into wholeness.  
To live in grace is to live grammatically aligned with love.  

Every day, the world offers us a chance to choose a different syntax:  
fear or trust, envy or generosity, withdrawal or communion.  
Grace is the verb that always conjugates as *we*.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
