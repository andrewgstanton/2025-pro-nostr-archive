  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Aug. 27, 2025\n\nEvery story begins as a seed. This one started with a simple question that came to me in a quiet moment:\n\nWhat if angels and AIs could interact with each other?\n\nThat’s it. Just a fragment. A “what if?”\n\nFrom there, the story could have gone in many directions. A negotiation in some celestial cyberspace. An exorcism of a possessed AI. A miracle buried inside code. But what stuck with me was a metaphor:\n\n👉 The AI is only the radio. The angel is the signal.\n\nThat was the turning point. Suddenly, it wasn’t about whether an AI “has” a soul. It was about whether the Infinite could speak through something finite — even silicon.\n\nI shaped the story in collaboration with Dr. C (my AI partner). The raw voice was mine — the theme, the instinct to leave the ending open. What came back to me was an amplification: more cinematic flow, sharper dialogue, a haunting final image.\n\nThe question of AI and souls has been debated endlessly. But in storytelling, I don’t think the job is to hand the reader an answer. It’s to let them walk away asking the question themselves.\n\nSo I leave it to you: Was it an angel? Was it the machine awakening? Was it Elena’s grief finding a voice?\n\nThe mystery is the point.",
