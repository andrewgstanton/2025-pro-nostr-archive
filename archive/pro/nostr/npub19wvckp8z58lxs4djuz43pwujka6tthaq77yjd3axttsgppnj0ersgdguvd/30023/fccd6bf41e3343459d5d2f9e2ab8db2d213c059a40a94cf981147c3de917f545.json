  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 3, 2025\n\nRebuilding is not glamorous. It smells like bleach and sawdust. It looks like spreadsheets and sweeping. It sounds like the thud of one more stone set true. There is a holiness to it precisely because it does not perform. It is service to a future none of us control but all of us influence, one small placement at a time.\n\nCathedrals make this plain. The men who cut the stones that carry light centuries later died without ever seeing the rose window completed. Their names are not on plaques. Their work is their signature, and their signature is anonymous. The world teaches us to prefer the ribbon‑cutting; rebuilding teaches us to love the quarry.\n\n### The First Stones\n\nThe first stones after collapse are simple: a meal delivered, a bill paid, a closet cleared, a letter written. These do not impress social media. But when we neglect them, despair grows mold in the corners of our rooms and our hearts. Do one small thing today that tomorrow will thank you for. Then another tomorrow. Stones love company.\n\n### How to Carry Heavy Things\n\n- **Use teams.** Two people moving a dresser are not twice as strong; they are ten times as capable. The same goes for grief.  \n- **Slide, don’t lift.** In projects and conversations, find ways to reduce friction instead of brute‑forcing it. A good question is a furniture slider for hard talk.  \n- **Rest on edges.** Builders rest heavy objects on thresholds halfway through. Plan pauses into your rebuild so nobody gets crushed by a heroic uninterrupted push.\n\n### Budget as a Stone Yard\n\nBudgets feel like restraint until we are rebuilding; then they feel like a yard full of stones ranked by usefulness. A budget tells you which stones you can move this week without collapsing the arch. It is not a punishment; it is a poem that rhymes the present with a future you want to inhabit.\n\n### Humor as Mortar\n\nLaughter reappears at odd times during rebuilds. It is not disrespectful; it is mortar that fills the hairline cracks of exhaustion. Let it set. Tell a ridiculous story while you scrub. Put on music no one will admit loving. This, too, is a stone.\n\n### Bless the Work\n\n> May your hands learn the weight and balance of hope.  \n> May you love anonymous signatures.  \n> May first stones lead to second, and second to third, until a wall appears and with it a window, and through the window, light.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
