  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 20, 2025\n\nFiat thrives on illusion. It pretends that debt is wealth, that printing is prosperity, that distraction is meaning. It treats death the same way: hiding it behind hospital curtains, euphemisms, and consumer rituals. In fiat culture, death is not faced, it is medicated away or denied until it can no longer be ignored.\n\nBut sovereignty demands truth. To live sovereignly is to look death in the eye. To acknowledge that you are mortal is not despair—it is discipline. Mortality clarifies priorities. It strips away vanity and urgency. It frees us to build with patience, to invest in legacies beyond our lifetime.\n\nCultures that denied death built monuments to themselves. Cultures that faced death built for the future. Cathedral builders accepted mortality and still carved stone, trusting their children’s children to complete the work. Today’s fiat builders seek quarterly profits, not eternal legacies.\n\nBitcoin is the antidote to fiat illusions. It refuses to hide truth. Its ledger is transparent, incorruptible, unchanging. In a fiat world of euphemism and denial, Bitcoin says: here is the truth, face it. It is both financial discipline and spiritual metaphor. Just as mortality forces us to reckon with the brevity of life, Bitcoin forces us to reckon with the reality of time preference.\n\nTo face death is to embrace sovereignty. To face truth is to build freedom. In both cases, the fiat illusion dies. What remains is hope: death as enemy, yes, but defeated. Fiat as illusion, yes, but exposed. Sovereignty as truth, yes, and eternal.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
