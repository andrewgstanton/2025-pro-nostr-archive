Grief is a kind of ledger. It records the things that mattered and the things that never really did. It settles accounts between illusion and truth.

In recent months I’ve learned that losing someone forces you to reckon with permanence — not the permanence of flesh, but of meaning. It strips away every pretense of ownership. You realize how little you truly control, and how much you merely steward for a season.

That’s why Bitcoin, strangely, feels like a metaphor for life and death. It exists on a chain of proof, not permission — a sequence of immutable records that persist beyond any individual node. The network continues even when participants fade.

When my father died, I found myself thinking about keys. Not just private keys, but the keys we all hold — to stories, to memories, to values. You can’t transfer a soul, but you can pass along conviction. You can sign a message in time that says, I was here, I believed this, I built this for you.

In a world of fiat promises — where institutions erase history with policy changes and inflation quietly steals from the dead — Bitcoin reminds us that truth can outlast mortality. A block added to the chain never disappears. The cost of falsifying it is infinite.

That’s what legacy really is: the impossibility of being erased.

Legacy is not an estate or a portfolio. It’s the continuation of integrity. It’s the echo of how you loved, what you built, and who you became.

My father’s life was not stored on a blockchain, but it’s etched in the hearts of those he loved. Still, the metaphor holds: every decision is a signed transaction in the moral economy of eternity.

Bitcoin, for me, exposed how fragile our cultural idea of wealth has become. We measure success in abstractions — numbers that shift with markets, titles that fade with time. But real wealth is continuity — the assurance that truth will persist even when we cannot.

When I hold Bitcoin, I’m reminded that security is not about possession but participation. The network doesn’t belong to anyone. It belongs to those who keep it alive.

So it is with legacy. The most valuable things we leave behind are not owned; they are continued.

In grief, I’ve come to see inheritance differently. It isn’t about what someone gives us, but about what we choose to uphold. You can inherit a fortune and squander it, or inherit an idea and multiply it.

Bitcoin teaches this principle every ten minutes. Each block testifies that something lasting can be built through simple, consistent, faithful work.

In a way, the proof-of-work principle mirrors the moral order of the universe: value is proven by cost, meaning by endurance.

Loss clarifies what’s real. Death humbles the ego that thinks it can secure itself through accumulation. The only true security is truth itself — what cannot be falsified or destroyed.

I don’t know how long my own work will last. But if it bears truth, it will find continuity somewhere, somehow — in others who pick up the keys and keep building.

That’s the beauty of an open network: no one owns the future, yet anyone can join it.

Legacy, like Bitcoin, is decentralized. It belongs to all who believe in its worth.

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
