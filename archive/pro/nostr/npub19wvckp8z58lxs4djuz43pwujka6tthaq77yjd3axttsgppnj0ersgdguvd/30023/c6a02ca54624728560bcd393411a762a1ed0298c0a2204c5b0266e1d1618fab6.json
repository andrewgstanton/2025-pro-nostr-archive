  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 29, 2025\n\n## **What This Chronicle Is (and Isn’t)**\n\nThis is not a work of “Christian fiction.”  \nThere are no allegories, no sermons hidden in story,  \nno symbolic characters meant to represent doctrinal ideas.\n\nThis is something different.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chronicles is a **Christ-shaped cosmology** —  \na universe whose deep structure reflects the truth that  \nall things were made through the Creator,  \nall things hold together in Him,  \nand the laws of physics themselves  \nbear the imprint of His sovereignty.\n\nChrist is not a character in this Chronicle.  \nHe is the architecture.\n\nThis story does not preach Him;  \nit reveals the universe He authored.\n\nWhere modern Christian fiction often focuses on religion,  \nthis Chronicle focuses on **reality**:\n\n- the structure of spacetime  \n- the coherence of quantum fields  \n- the physics of sovereignty  \n- the fracture at the heart of human history  \n- the long restoration unfolding across millennia  \n- and the rediscovery of systems aligned with creation’s design\n\nThis is a story about humanity,  \nabout sovereignty,  \nabout the cosmos,  \nand about the return to alignment  \nwith the architecture established from the beginning.\n\nIt is a science fiction universe built on a true metaphysics.  \nA sovereign story in a Christ-ordered cosmos.\n\nThe Chronicle begins here —  \nbefore the stars,  \nbefore humanity,  \nbefore history itself.\n\nWelcome to the foundation.",

      "summary",
      "The Preface clarifies the nature of the Bitcoin Chronicles: a Christ-shaped hard-science cosmology, not a work of Christian genre fiction. Christ is not a character in this story but the deep structure of reality — the architecture beneath physics, sovereignty, and the laws of creation. This framing prepares the reader to understand Book 0 not as allegory or religious fiction, but as a sovereign, scientifically coherent universe rooted in true metaphysics."
