  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 26, 2025\n\nThere’s a kind of ache that rises when you look at the night sky — not just wonder, but homesickness for something you’ve never known.  \nAstronomers call it curiosity; poets call it longing.  \nScripture calls it eternity written on the heart.  \n\nWe are beings of dust, yet our gaze is always upward.  \nWe study the heavens, we build rockets, we dream of living among the stars — and still, when the engines go silent, we whisper prayers from within our helmets.  \nWe know, deep down, that we don’t belong there yet.  \n\nWhen I imagine humans settling the Moon or Mars, I think of how fragile we truly are.  \nWe carry Earth inside us — its microbes, its air, its memories.  \nEven the water we drink and the food we grow must echo the chemistry of home.  \nWe’re not conquerors of space; we’re dependents of a gracious planet.  \n\nMaybe that’s the truth buried in Genesis: we were made from dust, not starlight.  \nOur strength lies not in escaping our origin, but in redeeming it.  \nEach act of exploration — each telescope pointed outward — is also a mirror pointed inward, reminding us who we are.  \n\nI sometimes worry that in our rush to reach the stars, we’ll forget the soil beneath our feet.  \nThat we’ll trade the humility of stewardship for the pride of possession.  \nBut then I remember how every great frontier also revealed new dependence.  \nSailors once crossed oceans thinking they’d find limitless wealth; instead, they found fragility — they found their limits.  \n\nPerhaps that’s what the Moon will teach us again: that even at our most advanced, we remain dust held together by grace.  \n\nSo I pray that when humanity finally lives off-world, we’ll carry that humility with us — that we’ll build not as owners, but as guests who have been invited to explore the house of God.  \n\nThe heavens will always belong to Him.  \n\nBut they still invite us — not to possess, but to wonder.  \n\nAnd in that wonder, maybe we’ll find our truest home: not between dust or stars, but between both.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
