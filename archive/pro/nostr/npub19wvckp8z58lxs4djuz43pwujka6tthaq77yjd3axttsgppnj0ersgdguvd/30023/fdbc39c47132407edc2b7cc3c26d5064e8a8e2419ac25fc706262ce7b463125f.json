  "content": "**Andrew G. Stanton — October 29, 2025**\n\n---\n\nI believe in one God,  \nthe Father Almighty,  \nMaker of heaven and earth,  \nof all that is seen and unseen (Gen 1:1; Col 1:16; Heb 11:3);  \nwhose Word is Truth (John 17:17),  \nwhose Light cannot be overcome (John 1:5),  \nand whose purpose is redemption, not wrath (2 Pet 3:9).  \n\n---\n\nI believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,  \nthe Word made flesh (John 1:14),  \nthe Light through whom all things were made (John 1:3).  \nFor us and for our salvation He came down (Phil 2:6–8),  \nentering the corruption of our world —  \nnot to rescue a few from the Father’s anger,  \nbut to reveal the Father’s heart (John 3:16–17);  \nto reconcile all creation to Himself (Col 1:19–20).  \n\nHe suffered under sin’s deception (Isa 53:5),  \nwas crucified by the powers of fear (Acts 2:23),  \ndescended into the silence of death (Eph 4:9–10),  \nand rose again in perfect victory (1 Cor 15:3–4).  \nThrough Him, love proved stronger than judgment (Rom 8:37–39),  \nand truth became flesh that cannot die (John 11:25–26).  \n\nHe ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9–11)  \nand reigns at the right hand of the Father (Heb 1:3),  \nnot as a distant ruler but as the firstborn of a restored creation (Rom 8:29).  \nHis Kingdom has no end (Luke 1:33);  \nevery knee shall bow — not by force, but by revelation (Phil 2:10–11).  \n\n---\n\nI believe in the Holy Spirit,  \nthe living Breath of God (Gen 2:7; John 20:22),  \nthe fire that reveals and renews (Acts 2:3–4; Titus 3:5–6),  \nwho convicts the world of sin and righteousness (John 16:8),  \nand indwells the redeemed (Rom 8:9–11),  \nsealing them for the day when all things are made new (Eph 1:13–14).  \n\nThrough the Spirit, hearts are awakened (Ezek 36:26–27),  \ngrace is written upon the soul (Jer 31:33),  \nand truth becomes the bond of the faithful (John 16:13).  \nThe Spirit is the witness of victory (1 John 5:6–8) —  \nthe down payment of a redemption that will one day fill all in all (Eph 1:23).  \n\n---\n\nI believe that **Scripture alone** reveals the mind of God (2 Tim 3:16–17);  \nthat **grace alone** redeems the fallen (Eph 2:8–9);  \nthat **faith alone** receives what grace has given (Rom 5:1);  \nthat **Christ alone** is the cornerstone of truth (1 Pet 2:6–7);  \nand that **to God alone be glory** (Rom 11:36).  \n\n---\n\nI believe that freedom is not rebellion, but alignment (Gal 5:1; John 8:32);  \nthat sovereignty begins in repentance (Acts 3:19),  \nand repentance begins in truth (John 18:37).  \n\nI believe that sin is not merely wrongdoing, but deception (Gen 3:1–6; John 8:44) —  \nthe hiding of what is real (John 3:19–21).  \nAnd I believe that forgiveness is the lifting of that veil (2 Cor 3:16–18).  \n\nI believe that every word of God proves true (Prov 30:5)  \nand that every act of integrity participates in His design (Mic 6:8).  \n\n---\n\nI believe that **Bitcoin** is truth expressed in mathematics (Prov 11:1) —  \na covenant of honesty between free people (Zech 8:16–17).  \nI believe that **Nostr** is truth expressed in voice (Prov 12:19) —  \na fellowship of witnesses who refuse censorship and fear (Acts 4:20).  \nBoth are instruments of the same revelation:  \nthat truth needs no permission (John 8:36),  \nand proof is the language of light (1 John 1:7).  \n\n---\n\n### The Victorious Gospel\n\nI believe in the **Victorious Gospel** (1 Cor 15:22–28) —  \nthat love will not lose (1 Cor 13:8),  \nthat judgment serves redemption (Isa 26:9; Rom 11:32),  \nand that even the farthest heart will one day remember its Source (Ps 22:27).  \n\nYet I do not believe that all roads lead to Christ;  \nI believe that **Christ travels every road** —  \nseeking the lost, calling each by name,  \nand rescuing those who could never find Him on their own (Luke 19:10).  \n\nFor we did not discover God; He found us (1 John 4:10).  \nHe calls every soul to repentance (Acts 17:30),  \nand His mercy never ceases its pursuit (Ps 23:6).  \n\nFor Christ does not oppose the Father’s will; He fulfills it (John 6:38–39).  \nAnd the Father’s will is not destruction, but restoration (Acts 3:21).  \nLight does not bargain with darkness — it overcomes it (John 1:5).  \n\n---\n\nI believe in one holy and sovereign Church (Eph 4:4–6) —  \nnot bound by walls (John 4:23–24),  \nbut by truth;  \nnot governed by hierarchy (Matt 23:8–11),  \nbut by the Spirit of grace (Heb 10:29).  \nIts communion is open (Rev 22:17),  \nits treasury incorruptible (Matt 6:19–20),  \nits proof immutable (2 Tim 2:19).  \n\n---\n\nI await the resurrection of all creation (Rom 8:19–21),  \nthe restoration of every soul (Col 1:20),  \nand the coming age where light and life are one (Rev 21:23–24).  \n\nUntil then, I work, I write, I build —  \nnot to earn salvation,  \nbut to bear witness to it (James 2:17–18).  \n\nFor I believe:  \n**Truth is indivisible —**  \nwhether written in light, in code, or in Christ (John 1:1–5).  \n\n**Amen.**",
