  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 22, 2025\n\nInheritance is fragile in fiat systems. Inflation erodes it. Taxes consume it. Lawyers dispute it. Children squander it. Fiat wealth seldom survives a generation intact. Mortality exposes the illusion of security. What seemed solid vanishes in probate.\n\nBitcoin changes this. It is incorruptible money. It cannot be inflated away, seized by decree, or consumed by bureaucracy. With multisig, it can even resist theft or loss. Bitcoin reframes inheritance as sovereignty. To pass on Bitcoin is to pass on freedom.\n\nThis is not only financial but philosophical. Bitcoin teaches discipline: low time preference, saving, resisting consumption. Parents who pass on Bitcoin are not only leaving wealth; they are leaving wisdom. They are entrusting their children with sovereignty, teaching them to live free.\n\nFaith reframes inheritance even deeper. Scripture speaks of inheritance in Christ: eternal life, incorruptible, undefiled, unfading (1 Peter 1:4). Earthly inheritance is fragile; heavenly inheritance is eternal. Bitcoin is not eternal life, but it is incorruptible money. It echoes the eternal by refusing fiat decay.\n\nTo give Bitcoin as inheritance is an act of defiance against death. Death claims finality, but Bitcoin endures. Death takes the body, but Bitcoin blesses children. Death ends one life, but Bitcoin extends sovereignty to generations. It is not eternal, but it is incorruptible, and that is enough to mock death.\n\nFiat inheritance fades. Bitcoin inheritance endures. To pass on Bitcoin is to pass on sovereignty. It is to declare that death does not erase, that hope continues, that freedom survives. It is the sovereign legacy, and it is the future.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
