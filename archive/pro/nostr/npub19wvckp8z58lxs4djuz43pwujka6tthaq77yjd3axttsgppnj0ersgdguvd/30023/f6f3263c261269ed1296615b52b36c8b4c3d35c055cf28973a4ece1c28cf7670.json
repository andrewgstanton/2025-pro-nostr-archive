  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 29, 2025\n\nBefore quarks spun into existence,  \nbefore time began its long unfolding,  \nbefore light first pierced the void—  \nthere was **the Pulse**.\n\nNot a sound.  \nNot a vibration.  \nNot energy as physics defines it.\n\nA **will**.\n\nA **presence**.\n\nA **sovereign resonance**  \nthat is older than existence itself.\n\nThe Pulse was *not* the beginning of the universe—  \nit was the pulse that made “beginning” possible.\n\nThe Creator did not ignite the cosmos with force,  \nbut with **intentionality**:\n\n- presence becoming event  \n- thought becoming law  \n- love becoming light  \n- order becoming spacetime  \n\nThis is the metaphysical bedrock of the Chronicles:\n\n> **Creation is not an accident.  \n> Creation is the overflow of the Creator.**\n\nStars exist because He desired radiance.  \nLife exists because He desired fellowship.  \nHumanity exists because He desired image-bearers  \ncapable of knowing His heart.\n\nThe Pulse is still beating.  \nStill resonating.  \nStill holding all things together.\n\nNot as metaphor.  \nAs literal sustaining reality.\n\nBook 0 begins here—  \nnot with physics,  \nbut with the One who gives physics purpose.",
