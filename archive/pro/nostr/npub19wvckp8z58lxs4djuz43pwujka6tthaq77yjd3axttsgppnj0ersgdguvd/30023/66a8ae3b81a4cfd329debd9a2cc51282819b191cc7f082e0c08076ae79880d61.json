Stanton - Nov. 27, 2025\n\nThey didn’t call it Thanksgiving anymore, not officially.  \nThe Lunar Council had a different term for it—*Commemoration Day*—a neutral phrase, engineered to fit across the diverse enclaves scattered from Shackleton Port to Freeport’s southern dome.\n\nBut settlers are stubborn.  \nAnd memories travel strangely across centuries, surviving where institutions fail.\n\nSo on the 27th day of the 11th cycle, a handful of the Freeport homesteaders gathered around a long steel table in Dome 3. There was no turkey, no cranberry sauce, no mashed potatoes. Protein blocks and hydroponic greens, yes. A thin sliver of lab-grown salmon if you were lucky. But they all knew what it *meant*.\n\nA day to breathe.\n\nA day to remember that survival had never been guaranteed — not in the Old World, not in the lunar mines, not in the quantum-flux storms that sometimes rippled through the entanglement arrays.\n\nAnd for a strange, almost haunting moment, it felt like home.\n\n### The Mayflower Echo\n\nAria Stanton (no relation to the author) stood at the head of the table. A historian by training, she often felt like she was living inside her own research: the early settlers of Plymouth, the fragile peace with the Wampanoag, the impossible calculations that shaped survival on foreign ground.\n\nShe knew the contradictions:  \nhow Christian hope had intertwined with failure, fear, miscommunication, and, later, devastation.\n\nBut she also knew the deeper truth — beneath the conflict, beneath the centuries of interpretation and reinterpretation:\n\nPeople survive by giving thanks.\n\nEven if imperfectly.  \nEven if the world they arrived in was already wounded.  \nEven if they misunderstood more than they knew.\n\n### A New Lakota Presence\n\nTwo representatives from New Lakota Colony had joined the gathering:  \nTashunka and Wiyohinyan, emissaries of the Free Peoples Treaty.\n\nTheir ancestors, centuries earlier, had never crossed paths with the original Mayflower settlers.  \nDifferent tribes, different landscapes, different histories.\n\nYet here they were in Dome 3, sharing protein-block casseroles under a sky made of reinforced aluminum.\n\nHistory folds on itself in strange ways.\n\nTashunka lifted his cup—filled with recycled water filtered through ten kilometers of lunar regolith—and said quietly:\n\n> “Every people has a story of crossing.  \n>  What matters is what you honor when you arrive.”\n\nAria felt those words in her chest.\n\nNot empire.  \nNot domination.  \nNot extraction.\n\nBut honor.  \nMemory.  \nGratitude.\n\n### Bitcoin Beneath The Surface\n\nEvery homestead on Freeport ran on sats.\n\nEnergy.  \nFood credits.  \nMedical supplies.  \nDocking fees.  \nHabitation tax.  \nWater rights.\n\nAll settled by lightning-fast transactions across the Freeport Mesh.  \nEven the entanglement array — the heart of the colony’s instantaneous matter-transfer experiments — had been partially funded by sovereign Bitcoin contributions from across Earth and Mars.\n\nOld sovereignty had been political.  \nNew sovereignty ran on hard money.\n\nHard money required hard truth.\n\nAnd hard truth required communities that remembered where they had come from.\n\n### The Prayer\n\nAt the end of the meal, Aria closed her eyes.  \nNot everyone prayed anymore.  \nBut some rituals transcend belief.\n\nShe whispered:\n\n> “Lord of life,  \n>  Keeper of the stars,  \n>  We thank you for the ground beneath us,  \n>  even when it is not the ground of our birth.  \n>  We thank you for the people beside us,  \n>  even when our ancestors walked different paths.  \n>  We thank you for the hope within us,  \n>  even when the world is fragile.”\n\nNo one objected.  \nOn the Moon, gratitude was practical, not ideological.\n\n### A New Holiday\n\nBy the time the dome lights dimmed, a new rhythm was forming.\n\nThey weren’t reenacting Earth traditions.  \nThey were forging something new — something that preserved the best parts of the old world without repeating the violence that had once defined it.\n\nIt wasn’t the Mayflower.  \nIt wasn’t Plymouth.\n\nBut it was a beginning.\n\nAnd beginnings, like gratitude, echo across centuries.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
