      "After just a few weeks of focused building, I'm releasing v1.0.0 of Continuum — a fully self-hosted, Bitcoin-aligned publishing dashboard for Nostr. This milestone marks a shift away from reliance on centralized clients like Primal, giving users full local control over their notes and articles with Markdown editing, SQLite storage, and timezone-aware publishing. Built with Docker, tested across browsers and platforms, and designed with sovereignty in mind, Continuum is now live and free to clone. Hosted and paid-tier features will follow. This is what it looks like to build protocol-first."
