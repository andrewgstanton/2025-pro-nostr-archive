Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 17, 2025

When I was younger, I imagined life as a straight road. If I studied hard, worked diligently, made careful choices, the path would unfold smoothly before me. Freedom would be the natural reward of discipline.

But life has a way of bending. The road winds. It doubles back. It detours through valleys we never intended to visit. Jobs vanish. Promises evaporate. Projects collapse. Even health falters. The straight road exists only in our imagination.

For a long time, I mistook these bends for failure. If the path was not straight, I assumed I must have gone wrong. But sovereignty has taught me otherwise. The winding road is not failure. It is reality.

Each curve contains lessons the straight road could never teach. Resilience grows not in uninterrupted success but in setbacks survived. Adaptability develops not when everything goes as planned but when plans fall apart.

Walking the winding road requires faith: faith that progress can exist even in detours, that growth can happen even in delay. It requires humility: the willingness to admit that our perspective is limited, that we cannot see the whole terrain.

The sovereign path is not about avoiding curves. It is about learning to walk them. About finding balance when the ground shifts. About seeing that a step sideways can still be a step forward if taken with clarity and resolve.

In this sense, the winding road is a gift. It breaks the illusion of control. It reminds us that sovereignty is not a destination but a way of traveling. Straight lines may look efficient, but they rarely build character. Curves do.

So if your road has bent unexpectedly, take courage. You are not off course. You are on the real course — the one that teaches, strengthens, and prepares you for freedom.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
