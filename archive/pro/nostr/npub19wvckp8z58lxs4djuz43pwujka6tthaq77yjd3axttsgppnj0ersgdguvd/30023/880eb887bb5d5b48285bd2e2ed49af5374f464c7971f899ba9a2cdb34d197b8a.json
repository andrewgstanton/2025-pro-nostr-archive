      "This essay explores three great transitions — the Unifier, the Turning, and the Threshold — as markers in humanity’s far future. It argues that Bitcoin is not only the money of our time, but the civilizational pillar that could sustain sovereignty across the next 2000 years."

  "content": "Most visions of the future cut history short. The Left Behind series compresses prophecy into decades, The Terminator and Matrix franchises reduce the Singularity to an AI apocalypse. But what if history is longer — stretching across millennia?\n\nIn this Chronicle I sketch the next two thousand years: the rise of the Unifier, the collapse at the Turning, and the unveiling at the Threshold. Through it all, Bitcoin endures as the covenantal pillar of sovereignty — incorruptible money that records our labor until history itself dissolves into eternity.\n\n👉 Full Paid article: *The Unifier, The Turning, and The Threshold: Bitcoin and the Long Arc of Prophecy*\n\n- 👉 Free Article 1 : *A Letter to Asimov*\n- 👉 Free Article 2 : *Why Myth Still Matters*\n\n🔒 **Full paid article available for 500 sats.** Zap me and I’ll send it via encrypted DM while I finish building the automated unlock flow in Continuum.",
