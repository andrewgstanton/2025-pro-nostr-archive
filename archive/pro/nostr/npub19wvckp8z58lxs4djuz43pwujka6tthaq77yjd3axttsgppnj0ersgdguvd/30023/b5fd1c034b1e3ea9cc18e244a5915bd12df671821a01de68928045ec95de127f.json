  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 18, 2025\n\nThe last few days have illustrated something I already knew but keep relearning:\n\n**Walled gardens are exhausting.**\n\nEvery platform — whether it’s LinkedIn, Amazon, Rover, YouTube, or Apple — has its own rules, its own fees, its own friction, its own logic of extraction. You don’t notice it when you only use one or two of them casually.\n\nBut when you rely on them?\n\nWhen you try to build something?\n\nWhen you try to earn income without letting half of it disappear into the algorithmic maw?\n\nThe seams show.\n\n### **The Rover tax**\nLet’s take Rover as the perfect example.\n\nRover is basically a peer-to-peer dog-sitting network if it were run by someone who had never owned a dog and had only read about them in articles titled “Top 7 Monetizable Dog Niches.”\n\nYou find a client.  \nYou do the work.  \nYou walk the dog at 6AM, 7PM, 10 minutes of tug-of-war, two Kongs filled with peanut butter…\n\nAnd Rover takes 20–25% *just because the introduction happened through them.*\n\nForever.\n\nEven on repeat bookings.\n\nEven when there is zero platform value left.\n\nIt’s the walled-garden model in perfect miniature:\n“You met through us — therefore we own the relationship.”\n\nIt’s the digital equivalent of a mall charging you rent for a store even after you’ve moved out.\n\n### **Amazon’s non-clickable absurdity**\nThen there’s Amazon and YouTube Shorts.\n\nYou have an affiliate link.  \nIt’s clean, simple, direct:  \n`https://amzn.to/...`\n\nIt’s 2025.  \nWe have AI agents, space tourism commercials, and Bitcoin passing six figures.\n\nAnd yet…\n\n**YouTube Shorts does not allow clickable URLs in the description or pinned comment.**\n\nYou can link from your channel “About” page, but not from the actual content people *see*.\n\nIt’s like owning a store where the door is located on a different street than your sign.\n\nEveryone says “creator economy” but everything feels like a series of limitations designed by committees who have never actually created anything.\n\n### **Walking three dogs at different speeds**\nThe whole situation reminds me of dog walking the past few days.\n\nBaxter is high energy.  \nWhiskers is a terrier mix with his own opinions.  \nMoki is bigger, more relaxed, but still needs movement.\n\nIf you walk all three together, you get chaos.  \nIf you split them, you double your time.  \nEither way, you're negotiating competing speeds, competing instincts, competing constraints.\n\nThat’s what using walled gardens feels like:\n\n- Rover wants fast-paced fee extraction.  \n- YouTube wants slow, controlled creator funnels.  \n- Amazon wants high-volume traffic but makes the path as indirect as possible.  \n- Instagram wants engagement but hides outbound links like state secrets.\n\nEvery platform is a dog pulling in a different direction.\n\nSo you build workarounds.  \nYou build your own website.  \nYou build Continuum.  \nYou build your own archive.  \nYou build your own identity layers.  \nBecause that’s the only way to stop being pulled apart.\n\n### **The quiet cost of platform dependence**\nPeople assume the problem is the money.\n\nBut the real cost is *time*.\n\nEvery friction point steals your time — and the irony is that it becomes harder to build sovereign systems because you’re busy wrestling the defaults built by billion-dollar companies.\n\nYouTube’s non-clickable links cost you momentum.  \nRover’s fees cost you trust.  \nAmazon’s strange restrictions cost you sales.  \nLinkedIn’s walled-garden messaging costs you sanity.\n\nIn aggregate?  \nThey slow your life down.\n\n### **The sovereign alternative**\nContinuum exists because of this exact problem.\n\nYou got sick of having your identity controlled by third-party authentication systems.  \nYou got sick of your writing being locked behind platform policies.  \nYou got sick of losing access to old posts, old threads, old memories.  \nYou got sick of corporate platforms acting like landlords in a digital city.\n\nSo you built your own house.\n\nThat’s sovereignty.\n\nNot perfection.  \nNot convenience.  \nFreedom — with responsibility attached.\n\nIt’s the freedom to walk Baxter at his own pace without having to justify it to an algorithm.\n\n### **Why people rarely leave walled gardens**\nIt’s not because they like them.\n\nIt’s because the alternative — building your own path — requires work.  \nMental, emotional, creative, infrastructural work.\n\nMost people avoid that work.  \nThey’d rather pay the Rover tax or tolerate the YouTube labyrinth.\n\nBut what they don’t realize is this:\n\nYou are already paying rent.  \nYou are already putting in work.  \nYou are already being drained.\n\nSovereignty doesn’t *add* effort — it replaces effort.\n\n### **Closing**\nWalled gardens are convenient until they're not.  \nUntil you need them to work for you instead of through you.  \nUntil you realize that every dog on the leash is pulling you somewhere you didn’t choose.\n\nSovereignty means letting go of those leashes — even if it means some extra walking.\n\nAnd yes, it’s tiring.  \nBut it’s also the only way to move at your own pace.",
