**Turning 60**

Ten years ago, I turned 50 with a vague sense that something was off.

I was building things, but they didn’t feel grounded.\
I was "in tech," but tech felt like a treadmill—just faster, sleeker tools chasing the same hollow outcomes.\
I knew about Bitcoin, but I dismissed it. I thought it was just “tech for tech’s sake.”

Less than a year later, I fell down the rabbit hole.

It didn’t happen all at once. At first it was curiosity. Then dissonance. Then conviction.

Somewhere in that process, I realized Bitcoin wasn’t just financial—it was philosophical. It was moral. It was *real*. And it held up a mirror to a life I had built on momentum more than mission.

So I started pruning.

I left Web3.\
I pulled back from projects that ran on hype instead of honesty.\
I repented—for chasing relevance instead of righteousness.\
And I began stacking—not just sats, but new habits. New thinking. New rhythms of faith, work, and rest.

Now at 60, I’m not where I thought I’d be.

But I’m more myself than I’ve ever been.\
More convicted.\
More rooted.\
More ready.

Not to start over—but to *build again*, from the foundation up.

If you're in that middle place—between chapters, between convictions, between certainty and surrender—you're not alone.

🟠 I’m still here. Still building. Still listening.

Zap if this resonates, or send your story. I’d love to hear it.
