  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept 10, 2025\n\nToo often we are told that faith belongs to the private sphere while freedom belongs to politics and technology. But reality is not so easily divided. Faith and freedom are not enemies—they are allies.\n\nThe language of sovereignty resonates deeply with biblical faith. From Israel’s cry for freedom from Egypt, to Jesus proclaiming liberty to the captives, the story of Scripture is one of deliverance. Freedom is not just a political slogan; it is a divine promise.\n\nBitcoiners speak of self-sovereignty: owning your keys, your data, your voice. The Gospel speaks of spiritual sovereignty: owning your life, your choices, your destiny in Christ. Both insist that dependence on corrupt powers—whether emperors or central banks—erodes our humanity.\n\nWhen faith and freedom meet, the result is not chaos but clarity. Faith grounds freedom in love, reminding us that sovereignty is not just about protecting ourselves but serving others. Freedom strengthens faith by demanding responsibility, honesty, and integrity.\n\nWe can see this bridge in practice. Christians who adopt Bitcoin in countries with high inflation are not abandoning faith; they are preserving families, churches, and ministries. Sovereign builders who embrace principles of love and service are not abandoning freedom; they are ensuring it has purpose. Both sides enrich one another.\n\nIn bridging faith and freedom, we are not blending two incompatible ideas. We are recovering an older truth: that to be fully human is to be both free and faithful. The prophets of Israel and the reformers of history understood this. What they sought was not blind obedience nor reckless autonomy, but the harmony of faith-filled freedom.\n\nBitcoin gives us tools for sovereignty; faith gives us the reason to use them wisely. Together they provide not just survival but meaning.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
