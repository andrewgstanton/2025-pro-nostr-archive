Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 28, 2025

Sometimes heaven feels closer than the air.
It does not appear with thunder or trumpets, but in the hush between breaths — the space where we realize this life and the next are not separated by miles but by veils.

That Sunday morning, light filled the room. My father slept. The world outside went on — traffic, dogs, laughter — but inside, time stood still. I understood then why Scripture calls death “gain.” It’s not because we leave behind what we love, but because what we love is gathered up and made whole.

Heaven is not elsewhere; it is home completed. It breaks in when we learn to see beyond fear. In those hours I stopped thinking about loss and began to glimpse restoration — a universe where nothing truly good is ever lost, only transformed.

Grief taught me to look through things, not at them. Every flicker of sunlight became a promise. Every breath, a rehearsal for resurrection.

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
