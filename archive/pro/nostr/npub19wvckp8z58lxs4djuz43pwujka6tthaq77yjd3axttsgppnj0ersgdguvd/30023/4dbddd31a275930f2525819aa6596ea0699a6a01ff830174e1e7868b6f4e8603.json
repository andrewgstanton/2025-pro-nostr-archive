  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 12, 2025\n\n## The Numbers\n\nBetween 2020 and 2023, analysts estimate that U.S. real estate wealth grew by **$20–30 trillion.** Homeowners saw values rise at record speed, especially in hot markets like Texas, Florida, and California.  \n\nOn the surface, this looks like an enormous success story: trillions of dollars in new wealth created in just a few short years. Realtors, lenders, and homeowners celebrated a housing boom unlike anything seen in recent memory.  \n\nBut scratch beneath the surface, and the paradox becomes clear.  \n\n---\n\n## The Paradox\n\n- **To realize the gain, you must sell.**  \n  Higher prices only matter if you exit the market. But selling usually means giving up the asset — your home, your rental property, your community. If you sell high, you still need to buy high elsewhere.  \n\n- **Refinancing = more debt.**  \n  For many, the only way to “tap” that newfound equity was through cash-out refinancing or home equity loans. But that doesn’t create real wealth — it just loads on more debt, binding the homeowner tighter to the fiat credit system and the interest-rate whims of the Federal Reserve.  \n\n- **Inflation eats the gain.**  \n  Rising prices of goods, services, and construction often cancel out much of the “wealth” created on paper. Yes, your house might be worth $200,000 more — but the cost of groceries, healthcare, and property taxes have also soared.  \n\nIn other words, the headline growth may not actually improve financial sovereignty. It can feel like getting richer while actually falling deeper into the system.  \n\n---\n\n## The Fiat Connection\n\nThis explosion in real estate wealth tracks almost perfectly with the Federal Reserve’s monetary expansion. When dollars are cheap and credit is loose, asset prices balloon.  \n\nBut this isn’t new value being created. It’s just the same property being **repriced in weaker money.** A house that sold for $400,000 in 2019 and $600,000 in 2023 didn’t suddenly become 50% better. It’s the dollar that got worse.  \n\nThat’s why so many homeowners feel “richer” on paper while also feeling squeezed by higher costs of living, property taxes, and interest payments. The mirage of paper wealth hides the reality of greater dependence on fiat leverage.  \n\n---\n\n## The Historical Lesson\n\nHistory shows us that every cycle of monetary debasement inflates asset bubbles. Land, stocks, and housing all appear to grow in value — until the tide turns. Then the debt remains, but the prices collapse.  \n\nThe last housing crash in 2008 exposed this clearly. Families who thought they were wealthy from real estate appreciation discovered they were actually overleveraged and under water. The cycle repeats because the underlying money remains soft.  \n\n---\n\n## The Bitcoin Contrast\n\nBitcoin exposes the paradox of real estate growth. A sat is always a sat. Its value cannot be inflated away by central banks or manipulated through cheap credit.  \n\nWhen Bitcoin appreciates, it’s not because the unit is being debased — it’s because the world is repricing property against a harder form of money. That growth is not a mirage of credit expansion but a reflection of true scarcity and trustless verification.  \n\nReal estate may hold utility — shelter, rental income, community ties — but its dollar-denominated growth often disguises fragility. Bitcoin’s growth, by contrast, reveals sovereignty.  \n\n---\n\n## Closing Thought\n\nThe paradox of real estate growth is simple: rising prices make you feel wealthier, but often leave you more entangled in the very fiat system that’s debasing the money.  \n\nPaper wealth can vanish in a downturn. Sovereign wealth, held in Bitcoin, cannot.  \n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
