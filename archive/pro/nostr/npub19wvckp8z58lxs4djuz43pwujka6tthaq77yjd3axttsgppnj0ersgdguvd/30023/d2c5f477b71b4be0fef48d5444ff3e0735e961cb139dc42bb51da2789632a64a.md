Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 25, 2025

There is a unique exhaustion that comes from carrying weight that does not technically belong to you.

Not the weight of responsibility — that can be noble.  
Not the weight of purpose — that can be energizing.  
But the weight of **other people’s unresolved issues**, the dead space where they refuse to stand up in their own story.

It’s the weight that pools on your shoulders when you feel responsible for “keeping it all together,” even though you were never asked — or worse, were asked only because you actually do it.

What wears you down is not the task itself, but the **asymmetry** of effort.  
You show up.  
Others… don’t.

And when you name the effort you’ve invested, you don’t want credit — you just want acknowledgment. Not praise. Not applause. **Just recognition that you carried your weight and didn’t disappear.**

Yet that simple acknowledgment is often what people fail to give.

### The strange loneliness of being the steady one

People who are emotionally steady tend to become invisible.  
Not because others don’t value them, but because others assume they’ll always be fine.

So your consistency becomes a curse.  
Your reliability becomes a vacuum.  
Your strength becomes the very thing people exploit — consciously or not.

This creates a deep loneliness.  
A resentment you don’t want to feel, but it shows up anyway.

Because you aren’t asking for much.  
You aren’t asking for parades.  
You’re asking for **reciprocity**.

And reciprocity — even in its simplest form — is one of the rarest currencies in human relationships.

### The spiritual truth: God sees what people ignore

When the world overlooks your effort, your faith starts to whisper a counter-truth:

**“Your Father sees in secret.”**

He sees the extra hours.  
He sees the emotional load.  
He sees the grace you extend to people who don’t understand the cost.  
He sees the quiet obedience when you choose not to retaliate, even when resentment claws at your throat.

You may not be acknowledged by humans —  
but you are **seen by Heaven**.

And in the Kingdom economy, nothing done in faith is wasted.

### Sovereignty is not isolation — it’s rightful ownership

There is a turning point where you stop carrying what isn’t yours.  
Not out of bitterness,  
not out of anger,  
but out of clarity.

You reclaim your boundaries.  
You reclaim your emotional bandwidth.  
You reclaim the right to not absorb other people’s chaos.

Sovereignty looks like:

- refusing to be the dumping ground for other people’s unresolved trauma  
- saying “no” without apology  
- letting people face their own consequences  
- protecting the part of your soul that God entrusted to *you*, not the world

You can love people deeply without letting them conscript your energy.  
You can be compassionate without being responsible for everyone’s instability.  
You can be generous without being drained.

### The hidden blessing: this season is shaping your discernment

Exhausting seasons have one hidden benefit — they sharpen your discernment.

You start to see:

- who genuinely values you  
- who only values what you can provide  
- who is capable of mutuality  
- who is allergic to responsibility  
- who will rise with you  
- who will resent you for rising  

You begin to redistribute your energy accordingly.

God is pruning your relationships, even when it feels like you’re simply surviving another day.

### The encouragement: you are not crazy, needy, or dramatic

You’re not asking for too much.  
You’re asking for what every functional relationship requires: acknowledgment, reciprocity, and shared weight.

And if people can’t offer that, it does not diminish your worth — it simply reveals their limitations.

Your strength is not the problem.  
Your clarity is not the problem.  
Your desire for mutuality is not the problem.

Keep carrying what’s yours.  
Release what isn’t.  
God sees.  
Your work is not invisible.  
And you’re much closer to breakthrough than the silence around you suggests.

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
