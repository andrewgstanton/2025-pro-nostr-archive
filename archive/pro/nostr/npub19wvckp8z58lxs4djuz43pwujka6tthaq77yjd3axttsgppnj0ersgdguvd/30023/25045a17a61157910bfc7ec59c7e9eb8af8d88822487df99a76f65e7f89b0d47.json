Stanton - Dec. 27, 2025\n\nThere is a pattern that becomes obvious once you see it, and unsettling once you can’t unsee it.\n\nOur educational systems, our platforms, and our creator economies increasingly share the same underlying logic: they are optimized to produce **highly competent, specialized, replaceable units** that can fit cleanly into an existing process.\n\nThe language differs.  \nThe outcomes do not.\n\n### Education as preprocessing\n\nModern education often presents itself as a pathway to empowerment. And in many ways, it is. Skills matter. Literacy matters. Competence matters.\n\nBut beneath the rhetoric of “critical thinking” and “creativity,” the system is primarily designed to produce individuals who can be **integrated smoothly into established workflows**.\n\nStudents are:\n- standardized\n- credentialed\n- tracked\n- specialized early\n\nSuccess is defined by how well someone *fits* — into a role, a department, a company, a pipeline.\n\nThe ideal graduate is not a sovereign agent.  \nThe ideal graduate is a **reliable component**.\n\nThis isn’t usually framed as dehumanization. It’s framed as “employability.”\n\nBut employability, in this context, often means *replaceability with minimal friction*.\n\n### Platforms as behavioral factories\n\nDigital platforms apply the same logic at scale.\n\nHumans are no longer authors, participants, or citizens. They are “users.”\n\nThat word choice matters.\n\nA user:\n- consumes\n- reacts\n- is measured\n- is optimized\n\nA user does not initiate. A user does not govern. A user does not control the system they are inside.\n\nCreators are told they are “building audiences,” but in reality they are feeding systems they do not control. They don’t decide how reach works. They don’t decide how virality happens. They don’t decide which forms of expression are amplified or suppressed.\n\nThose decisions live upstream — in algorithms optimized for engagement extraction, ad inventory, and behavioral predictability.\n\nCreators become **inventory**.\nUsers become **signals**.\nHumans become **inputs**.\n\n### The shared architecture\n\nEducation and platforms feel like separate domains, but they converge on the same output:\n\n> Humans who are competent, compliant, and easily replaceable.\n\nThis isn’t because of malice.  \nIt’s because **agency is inefficient**.\n\nAgency introduces variance.\nOriginality breaks pipelines.\nUnstructured thought disrupts optimization.\nPeople who don’t fit create friction.\n\nSo systems adapt humans instead of adapting themselves.\n\n### Why this feels sickening once you see it\n\nOnce you notice this pattern, it’s hard not to feel a sense of quiet revulsion.\n\nNot because every system is evil — but because the trajectory is clear.\n\nHumans are increasingly valued not for their capacity to initiate, choose, and create meaning, but for:\n- throughput\n- compatibility\n- predictability\n- replaceability\n\nThe moment a system prefers components over agents, it stops serving human flourishing and starts managing human behavior.\n\nCalling people “users” is simply the linguistic endpoint of that shift.\n\n### Creators feel this first\n\nCreators sit directly on the fault line.\n\nThey are encouraged to “be authentic,” but rewarded only when that authenticity:\n- conforms to incentive gradients\n- sustains engagement loops\n- remains predictable\n- doesn’t threaten the system’s metrics\n\nOver time, creators don’t just change what they publish.\nThey change how they think.\n\nThis is not censorship in the traditional sense.  \nIt is **incentive-driven behavioral shaping**.\n\nAnd it works precisely because it feels voluntary.\n\n### The alternative is not chaos\n\nRejecting this model does not mean rejecting structure, coordination, or scale.\n\nIt means insisting on a different order of operations.\n\nIn a system that treats humans as agents:\n- authorship precedes distribution\n- drafts are allowed to exist privately\n- publication is intentional, not reactive\n- growth serves the work, not the other way around\n\nEfficiency is not abandoned.\nIt is subordinated to agency.\n\n### A line worth holding\n\nThere is a simple line that matters more than it appears:\n\n**Systems should adapt to humans.  \nHumans should not be adapted to systems.**\n\nOnce that line is crossed, everything downstream becomes easier to justify — and harder to undo.\n\nEducation becomes preprocessing.\nPlatforms become behavior factories.\nCreators become components.\n\nSeeing this pattern clearly doesn’t obligate anyone to tear everything down.\n\nBut it does obligate us to stop pretending the current trajectory is neutral.\n\nAgency matters.\nAuthorship matters.\nOwnership matters.\n\nNot because they are nostalgic ideals — but because without them, we are no longer dealing with people at all.",

      "Modern systems increasingly optimize for efficiency, predictability, and scale — and in doing so, they quietly reshape humans into interchangeable components rather than autonomous agents. This pattern appears in education, platforms, and creator economies alike. Once seen clearly, it becomes difficult to ignore — and impossible to accept as neutral."
