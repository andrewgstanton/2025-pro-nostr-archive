Andrew G. Stanton - Aug. 30, 2025


When I first joined Nostr, I was confused about NIP-05. It wasn’t clear what it was, why it mattered, or how to set one up. Out of that confusion, I even signed up for Primal Premium because I thought that was the only way to get verified. Later, I discovered the truth: NIP-05 is simply a small JSON file you can host on your own domain. That’s it. No private keys involved. No magic. And it’s something you can — and should — control yourself.

I want to share what I’ve learned, because I know I’m not the only one who felt lost in the beginning.

## What NIP-05 Is (and Isn’t)

At its core, NIP-05 is just a way to connect your Nostr public key (npub) with a human-readable name that looks like an email address. For example:

```
you@yourdomain.com
```

Behind the scenes, this address points to a `.well-known/nostr.json` file on your domain that lists your npub. That’s all.

What NIP-05 **isn’t**: it’s not tied to your private key, it doesn’t give anyone access to your account, and it doesn’t change how your posts are signed. Your npub/nsec keypair remains fully sovereign. NIP-05 is just a verification layer, like an ID badge that proves “this npub is really me.”

## Why It Matters

Some might ask: “Why bother? Isn’t my npub enough?”

Here’s why NIP-05 is worth setting up:

- **Impersonation protection.** Without NIP-05, anyone can spin up an account and pretend to be you. I’ve seen multiple fake “Jeff Booth” accounts on Nostr. With NIP-05, only Jeff can link his npub to his real domain.
- **Trust and credibility.** If you’re public-facing — a builder, a writer, a speaker, a leader — people want to know they’re following the real you. NIP-05 provides that assurance.
- **Recognition.** A clean, simple identifier (like `name@domain.com`) is easier to share and remember than a long string of letters and numbers.

## Your Options for NIP-05

When you’re new, you might not know where to start. Here are the main paths:

1. **Convenience services.** Primal Premium and others will set up NIP-05 for you automatically. This is how I started. It works, but you’re paying for convenience, not sovereignty.

2. **Community domains.** I sometimes offer addresses under `mycontinuum.xyz` as a shortcut for people just starting out. To be clear: this is only a convenience, not a way to track or surveil you. You can always move your NIP-05 elsewhere.

3. **The sovereign way.** The best option is to set up your own domain. When you control the domain, nobody can take it away from you. This is what NIP-05 was designed for — verification that is portable, independent, and fully under your authority.

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Your Own NIP-05

Here’s how you can do it yourself:

1. **Buy a domain.** Any registrar works — Namecheap, Porkbun, Cloudflare, etc.
2. **Create a JSON file.** Save this as `nostr.json` with your npub inside:

   ```json
   {
     "names": {
       "yourname": "npub1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Upload it to your domain.** Place the file at:

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/nostr.json
   ```

   ⚡ **Tip for GitHub Pages users:** GitHub’s default Jekyll build will ignore folders starting with a dot (like `.well-known`). To fix this, create an empty file called `.nojekyll` in the root of your repository. That tells GitHub to serve the `.well-known` folder as-is.

4. **Edit your Nostr profile.** Add `yourname@yourdomain.com` as your verified NIP-05 address.
5. **Test it.** Check your profile on Primal, Amethyst, or Damus to see if it shows as verified.

That’s it — you’re sovereign.

## Closing: Sovereignty First

When I first started, I didn’t understand any of this. I paid for Primal Premium just to get verified, because the technical details weren’t explained clearly. Now I know better — and I want you to know better, too.

NIP-05 is simple. It’s just a text file on a domain. It never touches your private key. You can use a service if you want, or accept a community shortcut, but the ultimate goal is clear: **run your own domain and control your own verification.**

That’s what sovereignty looks like on Nostr.
