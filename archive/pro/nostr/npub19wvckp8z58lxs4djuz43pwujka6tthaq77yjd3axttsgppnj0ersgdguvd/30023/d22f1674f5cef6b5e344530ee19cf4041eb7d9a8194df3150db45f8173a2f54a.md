Yesterday, I booked (or thought I booked) a car with Zipcar. The plan was simple: 1:30–4:00 PM, quick Costco run. But when I showed up, there was no car. Turns out I hadn’t fully clicked through the last confirmation step. My fault — I’ll own that. Still, the end result was frustration: no car, wasted time, and my wife joking (not so jokingly) about me “slipping into senility.”

So today I made sure: same time slot, same car, but this time with both a screenshot and an email confirmation. At 1:25 PM, I walked down to the reserved spot. Again — no car.

This time, Zipcar admitted the car had been returned, but parked in another part of the city. They offered to redirect me to another car about an 8-minute walk away and even gave me 30 minutes of credit. But by then, the frustration had already snowballed. My wife asked me to cancel, so I did. End of story.

Except it wasn’t.

We ended up walking to Costco instead — about 45 minutes each way, taking the grocery cart we usually bring along when we use Zipcar. In the end, it turned out to be a good chance to enjoy the sunshine together and talk as we walked. We got everything on my wife’s shopping list (except for one item), so the day wasn’t lost after all.

## The Hidden Fragility of Convenience

Services like Zipcar promise to make life easier. Tap a few buttons, grab a car, get where you need to go. But behind that promise are dozens of invisible dependencies:

- Drivers returning cars to the right place
- GPS systems updating accurately
- App infrastructure working without a hitch
- Support agents empowered to fix problems

If even one of those pieces misaligns, the whole system collapses. What should be effortless becomes stressful. And the human fallout — blame, wasted time, relational strain — is often heavier than the logistical inconvenience itself.

## What Decentralization Could Look Like

Now imagine this differently. What if Zipcar weren’t a centralized service, but a decentralized network? Instead of one company bottlenecking reservations and assigning cars, you’d have a peer-to-peer system where available vehicles were openly visible.

If your reserved car wasn’t there, you could instantly call the next closest one without waiting on a support agent. Rules could be enforced by code and reputation rather than opaque customer service policies. The system would be more resilient, because it wouldn’t hinge on a single point of failure.

This isn’t science fiction. Decentralization is already happening in money (Bitcoin), communication (Nostr), and publishing (what I’m building with Continuum). The same principles could apply to transportation.

## The Bigger Lesson

It’s easy to dismiss a missed Costco run as a minor inconvenience. But it highlights something deeper: the fragility of the systems we lean on. The more centralized and opaque they are, the more powerless we feel when they break.

At the same time, our walk to Costco showed the other side of resilience: sometimes the backup plan isn’t glamorous, but it still works. Sovereignty isn’t about perfection. It’s about reducing dependencies on fragile systems, so when one piece fails, your whole day — or your whole life — doesn’t collapse.

For me, that’s the real takeaway from this little Zipcar fiasco: “convenience” isn’t always what it seems. Sometimes, the more resilient option is the one that gives you control, not the one that takes it away.

## Zaps Appreciated

If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers, just direct proof that this work matters. It helps me keep building Continuum and writing about sovereign technology, freely and without VC overhead. Thank you.
