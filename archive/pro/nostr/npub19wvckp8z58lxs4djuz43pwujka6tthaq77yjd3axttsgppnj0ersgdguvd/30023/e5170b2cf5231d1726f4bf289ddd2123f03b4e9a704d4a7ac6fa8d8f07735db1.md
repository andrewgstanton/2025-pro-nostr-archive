Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 27, 2025

As the year draws to a close, a familiar tension often surfaces. It is not always loud or obvious. Sometimes it arrives quietly, as a subtle pressure behind the eyes or a tightening in the chest. The sense that time is running out. That something important should already be further along. That you should be somewhere else by now.

This feeling rarely announces itself directly. It disguises itself as motivation, urgency, or self-reflection. But underneath, it carries a deeper fear: the fear of having missed your moment.

Sabbath interrupts this fear at its root.

Sabbath is not primarily about rest from labor. It is about rest from **measurement**. From comparison. From the internal ledger that keeps track of progress, outcomes, and perceived delays. On Sabbath, the question is no longer “How am I doing?” but “Am I willing to stop proving myself?”

The answer to that question matters more than most people realize.

You are not late.

Not to your work.  
Not to your calling.  
Not to the life that is still unfolding.

Time does not move the same way for all things. Some creations arrive quickly, loud and obvious, built for visibility and rapid consumption. Others grow underground for long stretches, strengthening their roots before anything appears above the surface. Both forms exist for a reason, but only the latter tend to endure.

The modern world is poorly equipped to recognize this difference. We are trained to associate speed with importance and visibility with legitimacy. If something matters, we assume it will announce itself quickly. If it has value, it will attract attention. If it is real, it will be validated by others.

Sabbath challenges these assumptions.

On Sabbath, we remember that the most significant work in human history rarely followed predictable timelines. Wisdom took generations to accumulate. Cultures formed slowly. Languages evolved through centuries of use. Even relationships — the kind that shape a life — unfold over years, not weeks.

Yet we regularly apply startup logic to the soul.

Why am I not further along?  
Why hasn’t this taken off yet?  
Why doesn’t this look more successful by now?

These questions are understandable. They are also deeply misleading.

Being early often feels identical to being behind. The difference only becomes clear later, usually long after the pressure has passed. In the moment, early work looks unfinished. It looks unsupported. It looks lonely.

But it is not wrong.

You are not late simply because others cannot yet see what is being formed. You are not late because the work requires patience. You are not late because the season you are in favors consolidation over expansion.

Sabbath offers a corrective vision: time is not a race you are losing. It is a medium in which meaning is formed.

Today, you are not asked to evaluate your progress. You are asked to trust that faithfulness accumulates even when it does not produce immediate evidence. That continuity matters more than momentum. That showing up intact is already enough.

Rest here.

Let the urgency loosen its grip.  
Let the calendar stop accusing you.  
Let the year end without a verdict.

You have not missed your moment.

Some things arrive precisely when they are ready — not when they are demanded.

And you are still here.
