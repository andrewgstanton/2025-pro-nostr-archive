### A Nostr-native protocol for portable, verifiable applications

---

## Abstract
Hiring today is fragmented across silos (ATS portals, job boards, custom forms). Candidates repeatedly retype the same data and lose control over their profiles; employers sift noise and fight fraud.  

**Sovereign Hiring (SH)** proposes a portable, cryptographically verifiable application built on **Nostr**. A candidate’s **npub** anchors signed résumé data, portfolio links, references, and attestations. Employers subscribe to candidate feeds (or request encrypted packets), verify signatures, and evaluate applicants without forcing them through a new portal.  

The result: less friction, stronger trust, and an open market for talent.

---

## Positioning

**Sovereign Hiring is not a platform or marketplace.**  
It is an **open protocol** for representing résumés and job applications using Nostr events.  

- **Neutral:** Any job board, employer, or candidate can adopt it without asking permission.  
- **Interoperable:** Works alongside existing job boards and communities — for example,  
  - **Bitcoiner Jobs** could accept sovereign applications natively,  
  - **Craigslist** could link to candidate npubs instead of email addresses,  
  - **Continuum** could serve as a reference implementation where users publish and update their Sovereign Hiring profiles.  
- **Candidate-first:** Applicants publish once and reuse everywhere.  
- **Employer-friendly:** Recruiters verify authenticity quickly and integrate at their own pace.  

By design, Sovereign Hiring strengthens the ecosystem as a whole — whether you’re applying through Bitcoiner Jobs, posting on Craigslist, or publishing a profile with Continuum. The protocol is **independent and open-source**, designed to reduce friction and increase trust across all hiring flows.

## 1. Problem statement
- Repetitive data entry across dozens of portals  
- Opaque black-box filters; weak verification; credential fraud  
- Candidates lose custody of their data; employers drown in noise  
- International applicants hit language/ID roadblocks  

**Goal:** give candidates self-custody of their application; give employers verifiable, machine-readable profiles delivered through an open protocol.

---

## 2. Design goals
- **Portable:** one profile works everywhere (bring your npub)  
- **Verifiable:** signatures, hashes, and optional third-party attestations  
- **Consent-based disclosure:** private items revealed selectively  
- **Minimal, incremental:** start with a few standard events; extend later  
- **Backwards-compatible:** renderable on the open web; works with any Nostr client

---

## 3. Core concepts
- **Anchor identity:** Nostr **npub** (kind:0 profile)  
- **Sovereign Application Packet (SAP):** signed bundle of résumé data, portfolio items, and references  
- **Open discovery:** employers follow npubs or query relays/indexers for SAPs  
- **Selective reveal:** sensitive docs shared via encrypted DMs or sealed events

---

## 4. Data model (v1)

### 4.1 Identity & profile
- `kind:0` — display name, avatar, bio, website, contact routes  

### 4.2 Résumé & experience
- `kind:30023` — human-readable résumé pointer  
- `kind:30078` — machine-readable résumé JSON  

**Résumé JSON example**
```json
{
  "schema": "sh.resume.v1",
  "name": "Andrew G. Stanton",
  "roles": ["Full-Stack Engineer","Communications Lead"],
  "location": "US-Remote",
  "skills": {"backend":["Python","Flask"],"frontend":["React"],"data":["SQL","Pandas"]},
  "experience":[{"org":"Continuum","role":"Founder/Engineer","from":"2024-01","to":"present"}],
  "links":{"site":"https://andrewgstanton.com","github":"..."},
  "ver": "1.0"
}
```

### 4.3 Work samples / case studies
- `kind:30023` — project summaries with tags (e.g. `["case:continuum","skill:sql"]`)

### 4.4 References & attestations
- Third-party signed notes with `["ref-for","<candidate_npub>"]`

### 4.5 Private materials
- `kind:4` DMs or sealed events for IDs, transcripts, or sensitive docs

---

## 5. Application flows

### Broadcast
- Candidate publishes SAP events to relays; employers search/filter  

### Targeted submission
- Candidate shares `nostr:sja:<npub>#resume` or HTTPS landing page  

### Selective disclosure
- Employer requests sealed docs via DM; candidate provides encrypted packet

---

## 6. Verification & anti-spam
- Signature checks  
- Hash commitments for large files  
- Optional PoW (NIP-13) for spam reduction  
- Attestation tags (`attested-by`, `completed-interview`, `offer-made`)

---

## 7. Employer experience
- **Zero-integration:** verify on a public landing page  
- **Low-code:** subscribe to a relay for SAP events  
- **ATS plugin:** map SAP fields into existing workflows

---

## 8. Privacy & safety
- Public résumé excludes sensitive info  
- Private docs only via encrypted sealed events  
- Updates via new SAP tagged `supersedes:<eventid>`  

---

## 9. Reference implementation

### Candidate app (v0.1)
- Build résumé JSON  
- Publish `kind:0`, `30023`, `30078`  
- Generate HTTPS landing page  

### Employer app (v0.1)
- Lightweight JS verifier  
- Simple shortlist UI using relay filters  

---

## 10. Adoption plan
- **Phase 1:** publish SH profiles via Continuum; create landing pages  
- **Phase 2:** pilot with 3–5 employers (Bitcoiner Jobs, etc.)  
- **Phase 3:** ATS plugins + attestation flows  

---

## 11. Call to action
- **Candidates:** publish your SH profile and include the link in applications  
- **Employers:** add “Accept Sovereign Hiring” to postings and test the verifier  
- **Community:** iterate schemas and reference implementations

## Appendix A — Candidate checklist
- Generate npub  
- Publish résumé JSON (`30023` + optional `30078`)  
- Add 2–3 case studies (`30023`)  
- Create a landing page  
- Share link in job applications  

---

## Appendix B — Employer checklist
- Add verifier widget  
- Search/follow SAP events by skill/location  
- Pilot alongside existing ATS
