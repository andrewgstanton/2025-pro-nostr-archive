never fully left Bitcoin. But for a while, I treated it like an asset — not a foundation.

It sat quietly in the background while I explored ecosystems that promised more features, more flexibility, more “community.” But the deeper I went into Web3, the more I realized what I was missing: clarity. Conviction. Limits that meant something.

Bitcoin never sold me hype. It just sat there, silently verifying everything.

***

When I finally returned to it — not as an asset, but as a *philosophy* — it wasn’t with fanfare.\
It was more like waking up in a room I had forgotten I built.

Reading *The Bitcoin Standard* didn’t just shift how I think about money.\
It reframed how I saw time, trust, and value itself.

&gt; Fiat incentivizes urgency.\
&gt; Bitcoin forces patience.\
&gt; Fiat rewards noise.\
&gt; Bitcoin rewards work.

It hit me: I had been operating with fiat assumptions in more areas than I wanted to admit — not just in trading or investing, but in how I approached relationships, goals, even faith.

***

I started pruning.

I stopped trading altcoins altogether.\
I stopped measuring success in dollars and started thinking in sats.\
I stepped out of endless Discord threads and Telegram pings — and felt *relief* I hadn’t known I needed.

I started building more quietly.\
And more honestly.

Even in my non-financial life, things began to change.\
Low time preference showed up in how I approached relationships.\
In how I treated rest.\
In how I stopped chasing every new opportunity and started focusing on *stewardship* — of capital, energy, and attention.\
And I’ve been trying to become more patient — though I think that’s more the Holy Spirit’s work in me than Bitcoin’s.

***

In some ways, it wasn’t just a return.\
It was a repentance.

A turning away from the illusion of infinite leverage, and back toward a system that demanded real cost.\
Bitcoin doesn’t flatter. It disciplines.\
And that’s exactly what I needed.

***

I didn’t need to be early to the next thing.\
I needed to go deeper with the one thing that still made sense.

Bitcoin didn’t need me to return.\
But I’m grateful I did.
