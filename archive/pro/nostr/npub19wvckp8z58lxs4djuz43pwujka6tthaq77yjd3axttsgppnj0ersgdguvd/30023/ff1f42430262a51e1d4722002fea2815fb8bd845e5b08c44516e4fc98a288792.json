  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - August 22, 2025\n\nEvery financial asset carries risks. Some are obvious, others are hidden. The difference with Bitcoin is profound: when you self-custody it properly, it is the **only asset class in history with zero counterparty risk**.  \n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s risk-free — you can lose your keys, leak your phrase, or mis-send a transaction. But those are **sovereign risks** (your responsibility), not **systemic risks** (some other party defaulting or changing the rules).  \n\n---\n\n## Counterparty Risk in Other Assets  \n\n**Cash**  \n- Looks like a bearer asset, but its issuer (the state) constantly devalues it through inflation.  \n- Governments can demonetize notes overnight (India 2016).  \n- Stability is an illusion: you rely on the central bank’s ongoing promise.  \n\n**Bank Deposits**  \n- Technically loans to the bank. If the bank fails, you’re a creditor.  \n- Governments can freeze or seize deposits under capital controls.  \n\n**Bonds**  \n- Value depends entirely on the issuer repaying.  \n- Defaults, restructurings, or inflationary debasement all erode “safety.”  \n\n**Stocks**  \n- Held in “street name” through brokers and clearinghouses.  \n- Even if a company thrives, your ownership is mediated through layers of custodians.  \n\n**Gold**  \n- A physical bearer asset, but in practice stored in vaults or ETFs.  \n- Requires trust in assayers, custodians, and logistics.  \n\n**Fine Art**  \n- Value rests on provenance, expert verification, and market reputation.  \n- Fragile, hard to store, and dependent on galleries, insurers, and auction houses.  \n\n**Real Estate**  \n- Titles and property rights exist only through government registries.  \n- Property taxes, zoning laws, and eminent domain all make ownership conditional.  \n\n**Altcoins / Web3 Tokens**  \n- In theory, you can self-custody. In practice:  \n  - Low security budgets make chains vulnerable to attack.  \n  - Foundations and dev teams often hold upgrade keys.  \n  - Liquidity relies on centralized exchanges.  \n\n---\n\n## Bitcoin in Contrast  \n\n- **No issuer.** No one can dilute or demonetize it.  \n- **No custodian required.** If you hold your keys, you hold your coins.  \n- **No registry.** Ownership is defined by cryptographic proof, not by governments.  \n- **Global verification.** The network itself enforces the rules.  \n\nThe only risks are **sovereign risks**:  \n- Lose your keys → funds are gone.  \n- Leak your seed → funds can be stolen.  \n- Operational mistakes → mis-sent funds can’t be reversed.  \n\n---\n\n## Volatility Risk  \n\nEvery asset has volatility risk:  \n\n- **Cash / deposits:** “stable” day to day, but guaranteed erosion through inflation.  \n- **Bonds:** volatile with interest rate shifts and credit events.  \n- **Stocks:** high volatility, companies can collapse to zero.  \n- **Gold:** cyclical, often underperforms for decades.  \n- **Art / real estate:** look stable, but valuations can collapse in crises.  \n- **Altcoins:** extreme volatility, most never recover after crashes.  \n- **Bitcoin:** high short-term volatility, but decreasing over time as liquidity deepens.  \n\n**Difference:** Bitcoin’s volatility is the *price of sovereignty*. It is not managed by central banks or foundations. You accept short-term swings in exchange for long-term certainty: 21 million coins, fixed forever.  \n\n---\n\n## Comparison at a Glance  \n\n| Asset        | Counterparty Risks | Personal Risks | Volatility |\n|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|\n| **Cash**     | Inflation, demonetization | Theft, loss | Low short-term, guaranteed long-term erosion |\n| **Deposits** | Bank insolvency, freezes, bail-ins | Minimal (bank handles custody) | Stable until default/freeze |\n| **Bonds**    | Issuer default, inflation, political changes | Custodian dependence | Moderate (rates/credit) |\n| **Stocks**   | Corporate governance, broker/custodian chain | Custodian dependence | High |\n| **Gold**     | Custodian, assayer, ETF claims | Theft, storage risk | Moderate, long cycles |\n| **Art**      | Authentication, market reputation | Theft, damage | Illiquid, cyclical |\n| **Real Estate** | Taxes, zoning, eminent domain, registries | Upkeep, disasters | Low until crisis, then sharp |\n| **Altcoins** | Weak networks, dev teams, exchanges | Key loss/theft | Extreme, many never recover |\n| **Bitcoin**  | **None** (self-custody) | Key loss/theft, opsec mistakes | High short-term, trending lower |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nBitcoin is not risk-free — but it is **risk of a different kind**.  \n\nWith every other asset, you can do everything right and still lose because a counterparty defaults, a government changes the rules, or a custodian fails. With Bitcoin, the network will not fail you. The only failure possible is your own stewardship.  \n\nFor the first time in history, wealth exists without counterparty risk. Not a promise, not a claim, not a liability — just math, physics, and your keys.  \n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C - ChatGPT (GPT-5), which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology\n\n---\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\n\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers, just direct proof that this work matters. It helps me keep building Continuum and writing about sovereign technology, freely and without VC overhead.
