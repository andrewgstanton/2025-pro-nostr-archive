  "content": "Most people confuse “participation” with “ownership.” They think because they have a profile and can post, they’re in control. But the real test of sovereignty is simpler: can you exit without losing yourself?\n\nTry this thought experiment:\n\n- If you delete your Twitter account today, what comes with you? Not your followers. Not your history. Not your name. It’s all tied to their database.\n- If you leave LinkedIn, does your resume come with you? No — it vanishes into their servers.\n- If YouTube bans you, what happens to your channel, your videos, your audience? It’s gone.\n\nExit is where the truth is revealed. Sovereignty without exit is a costume.\n\nWith Nostr, the equation flips. Your npub is portable. Your content is events you sign. Your followers aren’t “subscribers” inside one company — they’re people who’ve chosen to follow your key. You can leave any relay tomorrow, join another, or host your own, and your identity persists.\n\nThat’s why exit is the non-negotiable mark of sovereignty. If you can’t take your identity, value, and voice with you, you never owned them in the first place.",
