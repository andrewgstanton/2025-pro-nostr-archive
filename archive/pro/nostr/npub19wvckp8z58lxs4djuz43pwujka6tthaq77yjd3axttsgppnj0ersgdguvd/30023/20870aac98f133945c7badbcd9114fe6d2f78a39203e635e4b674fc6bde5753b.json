  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 22, 2025\n\nWalk into any grocery store today, and you’ll see it: prices climbing, packaging shrinking, and yet, somehow, everyone pretending it’s normal. The trick of fiat inflation isn’t only economic—it’s psychological. When money loses meaning, so does value itself.\n\nInflation creeps into language, art, attention. We scroll faster, spend quicker, and chase novelty instead of quality. Everything feels more expensive because everything is more *empty*. \n\nWe are not paying more for food or rent—we’re paying for the illusion that the system still works.\n\nWhen dollars multiply, time devalues. When time devalues, culture rots. The result is an economy of exhaustion—people working harder, earning less, and buying worse. Fiat doesn’t just erode savings; it erodes taste, judgment, and dignity. \n\nBitcoiners feel this most acutely because they’ve opted out of the lie. When you anchor your life to something finite, the infinite noise of fiat becomes unbearable. You start noticing the inflation of *everything*—from celebrity activism to corporate virtue signals. It’s all debt, all deficit, all drag.\n\nSound money isn’t just a hedge against inflation—it’s a defense against cultural entropy.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
