## Why I Think — and Build — Differently  
### And Why the Gospel I Believe Refuses to Be Tamed

For most of my life, I didn’t have a name for how I thought.  
I just knew I wasn’t like most people around me.

I’d jump from idea to idea, branching off into deep dives, strange metaphors, and systems no one had built yet — but which, somehow, already existed in my head. Other times I’d lock in and disappear for hours, obsessively refining a system or vision until it finally felt whole.

I used to think this was just creativity. Later I wondered if it was ADHD. But only recently have I found language — and peace — in the term **neurodivergent**.

It doesn’t mean broken.  
It means different.  
And for me, it’s also meant… *free*.

## What Neurodivergence Taught Me About the Gospel

I used to think the Gospel was about trying harder.  
Trying to fit. Trying to follow. Trying to conform to the narrow version of what a “good Christian” looked like in the eyes of church culture.

But the more I tried to contort myself into that image, the more I felt like I was slowly dying.  
Not just spiritually — mentally, emotionally, even creatively.

And then I discovered something I now call the **Victorious Gospel** — not a half-measure, not a rescue plan for a few, but a bold, cosmic declaration:

> **God wins. All things will be made new. Nothing is wasted.**

In that Gospel, I didn’t have to be tamed.  
I didn’t have to suppress the way my mind works.  
I didn’t have to squeeze myself into man-made molds of productivity, piety, or professionalism.

Instead, I began to see that my wiring — my urgency, my depth, my discomfort with compromise — might actually be part of how God made me.  
Not a bug to be fixed. A feature to be wielded.

## Refusing the Cages

I’ve never done well with cages.

I don’t mean physical ones. I mean the subtle ones — platforms, protocols, and polite expectations that tell you:

> “Don’t say that.”  
> “Don’t build that.”  
> “Don’t think like that.”

Walled gardens. Sanitized feeds. Centralized rules.

They look like safety.  
They smell like order.  
But they’re designed to **tame**.

And I believe the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead — the same Spirit that will one day renew *all things* — does not operate inside cages.

That Spirit breaks chains.  
That Spirit sets captives free.  
That Spirit burns through the protocols of empire, and says:  
> **“Behold, I am making all things new.” (Rev 21:5) **

That includes minds like mine.  
That includes the systems I build.  
And that includes the very way we think about software, identity, and sovereignty.

## What I’m Building Now

I’m building tools that don’t assume conformity — they assume **conviction**.

**MyContinuum** is a publishing stack for people who think differently, share differently, refuse to depend on centralized platforms, and want to own their digital voice.

I don’t want to rely on LinkedIn to share truth.  
I don’t want to depend on Google to access my own memories.  
And I don’t want the Gospel — or the systems I build — to be shaped by companies whose values are fundamentally incompatible with freedom.

I want to create space for people like me — people who think in arcs, not boxes.  
Who resist control, but are driven by clarity.  
Who may be misunderstood by church or tech culture, but who burn with something deeper than performance.

## Final Word

Maybe you resonate with this. Maybe you’ve always felt a little outside.  
Maybe your mind works differently, too.

You don’t need a diagnosis to know you weren’t built to conform.  
You were built to create. To question. To seek truth.  
To reflect the wild, untamable image of a God who is not finished redeeming the world.

So no — I won’t fit into their systems.  
Because I’m finally building **mine**.

And I believe God’s not only okay with that —  
**He’s the one who wired me to do it.**
