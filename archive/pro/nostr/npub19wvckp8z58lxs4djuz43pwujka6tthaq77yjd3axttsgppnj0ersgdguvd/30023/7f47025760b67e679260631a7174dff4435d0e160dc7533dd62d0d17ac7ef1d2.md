The Chronicles begin with a truth too large for human eyes:

> **The universe is so full of God’s glory we cannot yet see it.**

Not because the glory is faint,  
but because it is *overwhelming*—  
woven into spacetime,  
resonating through the quantum fields,  
and burning at the center of every star.

What humanity calls “physics”  
is the measurable surface  
of an immeasurable radiance.

Book 0 begins here:  
with glory too vast for the senses,  
yet destined to be revealed.
