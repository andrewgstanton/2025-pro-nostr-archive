Stanton - June 11, 2025\n\n### 🌋 *Ka ʻImi i ka Pono: Seeking What’s Right*\n\n**A 7-Day Series on Sovereignty, Bitcoin, and the Soul of the Islands**\n\n&gt; *\"Man is not free unless he wills to be free.\"*\\\n&gt; — Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n\nHawai‘i understands sovereignty. It always has.\\\nBut it was taken — first with pen and politics, then with force and fiat.\n\nBitcoin offers something different:\\\nA way to reclaim sovereignty without violence.\\\nA tool for self-rule, not state rule.\\\nA system built not on empire, but on truth and time.\n\nThis week, I’ll be posting a 7-part series exploring this tension:\\\nBetween the Hawai‘i that *was*, the system that *is*, and the future that *might be* — if we choose to *build on bedrock instead of paper*.\n\nI don’t know if there’s a traditional Hawaiian word for a 7-day week — maybe there doesn’t need to be.\\\nTime moves differently on these islands.\\\nBut for the next 7 days, I’ll mark each reflection as a kind of modern *lā hoʻomanaʻo* — a day of remembering, reckoning, and restoring.\n\nThis is personal. It’s philosophical. It’s also unfinished.\n\nBut that’s what sovereignty looks like:\\\n*Not something given — something reclaimed.*\n\nStay tuned. Stay akamai.\\\n🟧\\\n— *Andrew G. Stanton (aka akamaister)*",
