Andrew G. Stanton - August 24, 2025

In 2022, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for their pioneering work on quantum entanglement. Their experiments proved that particles can be mysteriously connected across distance — influencing each other instantly, in ways that defy classical categories of space and time.

My friend Phil recently shared a short clip about this discovery, and it prompted me to reflect on how often science takes decades (or centuries) to confirm what ancient wisdom has long declared: that life is profoundly interconnected.

Dr. Catherine Clinton put it this way: *“Science is coming full circle back to what the ancients always spoke of.”*

## Wisdom Across the Ages

This recognition of deep interconnection is not unique to the prophets of Israel. Ancient cultures across the world — from Eastern philosophies to indigenous traditions — carried echoes of the same insight: life is bound together in ways that transcend the visible.

What Scripture contributes is a uniquely covenantal lens.

-  In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), Israel is bound as one people before God. Blessings and curses ripple through the community — what one member does, all feel.

- In the New Testament, Paul speaks of the Body of Christ: *“If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.” (1 Cor. 12:26)*

- Christ himself prayed in John 17 that his followers “may be one, even as We are one.”

In other words, the Bible affirms what many ancient traditions intuited: we are distinct, but never detached. Sovereign, but never isolated.

## Freedom in Connection

Modern culture tells us freedom is radical autonomy — detachment, independence at all costs. But the biblical worldview offers something richer: freedom as covenantal belonging. We are set free to serve, to love, to live in a body larger than ourselves.

Entanglement reminds us: true sovereignty is never isolation. It is freedom-with-connection.

## Sovereign Systems, Entangled Design

The digital realm is catching up.

- **Bitcoin**: each node is independent, yet all are bound to a shared ledger no one can alter.
- **Nostr**: each identity flows from a private key, yet all are linked in a global conversation.

These systems are not centralized towers of Babel. They are webs of entanglement — local expressions woven into a global truth.

Paul once wrote of Christ, “He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.” (Col. 1:17) Bitcoin and Nostr are imperfect reflections of this deeper reality: systems where many become one, and one sustains the many.

## Full Circle

The 2022 Nobel Prize was more than a scientific milestone. It was a reminder: truth endures, even when forgotten. The ancients across cultures intuited it. The prophets proclaimed it. Scripture reveals it in fullness. And physics is now confirming it in its own language.

We stand at a crossroads. We can build systems of centralization that deny this fabric, or we can align with technologies that honor it — sovereign yet connected, free yet belonging.

Science is catching up. Wisdom has always known. And Bitcoin points us forward: a money woven into reality as it truly is.
