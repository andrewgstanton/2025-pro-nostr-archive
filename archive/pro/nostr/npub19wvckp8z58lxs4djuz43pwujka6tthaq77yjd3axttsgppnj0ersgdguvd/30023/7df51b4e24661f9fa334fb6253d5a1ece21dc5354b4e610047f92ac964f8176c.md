The Free Launch Era gave Luna its culture.  
The Shackleton Circle gave Luna its law.  
The Pelagia Compact gave Luna its political identity.  
The Archivists gave Luna its memory.

But something was still missing.

Luna needed **a canon** — a collection of wisdom that the next generation could inherit.

Not dogma.  
Not scripture.  
Not ideology.

But something older:

> **The shared truths a people discover  
> when they become free together.**

---

## **I. The Gathering**
The Archivists began informally.

Children sat in mining corridors and asked:

- “Why do we use circles instead of councils?”  
- “Why does Freeport have no flags?”  
- “Why does the Archive belong to everyone?”  
- “Why don’t we lie, even when it’s easier?”

Elders responded with stories.  
Guild members responded with examples.  
Lakota teachers responded with teachings.

The Archivists listened.

They began gathering:

- oral histories  
- founding oaths  
- Pilgrim journals  
- Lakota reflections  
- technical treatises  
- engineering diaries  
- Circle logs  
- early Bitcoin settlement records  
- covenant texts from Pelagia  
- fragments of “Sovereign Texts” carried from Earth

At first, they called it the **Common Ledger of Wisdom**.

Later, simply:

> **The Sovereign Canon.**

## **II. The Ten Pillars**
The Archivists never declared the Canon complete.  
But they agreed that ten principles formed its heart:

### **1. Truth is oxygen.**  
Civilizations die when lies become air.

### **2. Sovereignty is a natural law.**  
Not granted by states.  
Not revocable by power.  
Inherent in every image-bearer.

### **3. Authority dissolves.**  
Circles must dissolve.  
Guilds must decentralize.  
Power must be temporary.

### **4. Memory is sacred.**  
Archive everything.  
Erase nothing.  
Annotate, but never alter.

### **5. The land is not owned.**  
Whether Earth, Luna, or Mars—  
we belong to the land, not the reverse.

### **6. Stewardship is responsibility.**  
Build what increases life.  
Maintain what sustains life.  
Repair what protects life.

### **7. Settlement must be honest.**  
Bitcoin is not ideology.  
It is the discipline of truth.

### **8. Identity is chosen.**  
A person is who they sign themselves to be.  
No census.  
No registry.  
Only the commitments they keep.

### **9. Freedom is voluntary.**  
Coercion is defeat.  
Compulsion is failure.  
Only voluntary association creates true community.

### **10. The frontier is sacred.**  
The frontier is where humanity remembers  
who it is meant to be.

These Ten Pillars became the ethical backbone of lunar civilization.

## **III. The Canon Rooms**
Deep in the Archive Vault, the Archivists carved out the **Canon Rooms**:

- ten alcoves  
- one for each pillar  
- each with artifacts, engravings, and founding texts  
- each lit by soft bioluminescent algae curtains  
- each inscribed with the phrase:

> *“Sovereignty is remembered before it is learned.”*

Guild apprentices and Freeport children made pilgrimages to the Canon Rooms as a rite of passage.

Some wept.  
Some felt awe.  
Some felt a profound peace.

All left changed.

## **IV. The Canon’s Influence on Pilgrim-9**
When Pilgrim-9 prepared for the journey to Mars, the Archivists sent one gift:

- a sealed, laser-etched copy of the Sovereign Canon  
- compressed into a sapphire memory disc  
- engraved with a single blessing:

> *“Carry forward what we learned  
> so the next world may be freer than this one.”*

The Canon became the philosophical foundation of Martian governance.

Terraformers, Reckoners, and settlement engineers would later quote passages from the Canon as if they were proverbs.

Pilgrim-9 did not carry a constitution.  
It carried *the Canon*.

---

## **V. Legacy**
The Sovereign Canon is not a scripture.  
It is not a holy book.

It is a memory.

A shared understanding.

A compact of wisdom carried by people who learned what freedom truly means  
during the long years of dust, struggle, and invention under the dim light of the lunar south pole.

Centuries later, Martian elders in the Great Basin would still recite from the Canon:

> *“We remember what they learned,  
> because we are building what comes next.”*

The Canon is the hinge between worlds.  
The bridge from Luna to Mars.  
The birthright of every sovereign people.
