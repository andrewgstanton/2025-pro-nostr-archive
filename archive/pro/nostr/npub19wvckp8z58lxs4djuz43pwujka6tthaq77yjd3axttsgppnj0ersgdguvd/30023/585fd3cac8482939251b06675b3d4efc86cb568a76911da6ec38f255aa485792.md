The earliest Earthbound Chronicles are unusual within the Sovereign Archive for one reason:  
they retain precise Gregorian dates.

This was not a narrative choice.  
It was a historical constraint.

Prior to the Pilgrim era, humanity measured time the same way it measured authority—through centralized reference systems. Calendars, currencies, and communications were synchronized not by consensus, but by decree. Earthbound institutions demanded uniform timestamps as a condition of legitimacy.

The Archivists have preserved these dates intact for three reasons.

First, **they anchor divergence**.  
These records sit at the boundary between documented history and sovereign emergence. The dates mark the final moments when centralized timekeeping still held uncontested authority over human memory.

Second, **they reveal the pattern**.  
Bretton Woods (1944), national communications consolidation (1957), and suppressed cryptographic research (1963) were not isolated incidents. When viewed together, their timestamps expose a recurring cycle:  
centralization, justification, suppression, forgetting.

Third, **they explain the refusal**.  
The Pilgrim generation did not abandon Earth arbitrarily. They inherited a world where even time itself had become permissioned. Precise dating shows what was being escaped.

After the first free launches, the Chronicles shift away from Gregorian reference. Lunar settlements adopted ledger-relative time. Martian charters marked eras by covenant, not calendar. The Belt used transaction epochs. Later civilizations abandoned linear dating entirely in favor of relational sequence.

Time, like money, became sovereign.

Thus, the Archivists retain Earthbound dates not as endorsements of the old order, but as artifacts of it—fossils embedded in the record to remind future generations what centralized authority once required.

These timestamps are not coordinates to return to.  
They are markers of a world humanity chose to outgrow.
