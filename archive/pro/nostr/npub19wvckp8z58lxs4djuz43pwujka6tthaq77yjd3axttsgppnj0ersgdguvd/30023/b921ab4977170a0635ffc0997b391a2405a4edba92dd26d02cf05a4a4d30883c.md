For years, I wandered through the Web3 space—intrigued by its promises, pulled in by buzzwords like “decentralization,” “DAOs,” and “stakeholder democracy.”

But over time, the signals got drowned out by noise.

I saw venture capital pour into projects that had no product. I watched communities reward performative governance and token hype, rather than real work or impact. Even in faith-based circles, “Web3 for good” often meant shiny apps that served insiders more than outsiders.

Then I found my way back to where I began: **Bitcoin.**

Not as a speculative asset—but as a philosophy. A discipline. A foundation.

**Proof of Work** doesn’t need marketing. It doesn’t ask for permission. It either works—or it doesn’t.

Web3 taught me a lot. But Bitcoin gave me a plumb line. And from now on, that’s the line I’m building on.

This is Part 1 of a multi-part series. Follow for future entries.
