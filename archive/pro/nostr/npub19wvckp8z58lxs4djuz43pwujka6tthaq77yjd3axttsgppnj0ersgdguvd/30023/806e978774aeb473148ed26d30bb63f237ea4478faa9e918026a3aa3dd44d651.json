Stanton - Nov. 23, 2025\n\n\nThere is a reason the earliest Christians met on the first day of the week — the day of resurrection.  \nNot the end of the week.  \nNot the midpoint.  \nThe beginning.\n\nResurrection is not simply the reversal of death.  \nIt is the **renewal** of life.  \nA new start.  \nA new creation.\n\nAnd in many ways, that pattern — renewal on the first day — is the pattern the modern world longs for. Because for all our wealth, speed, noise, and technology, we live in a society where people feel:\n\n- crushed by debt  \n- alienated from ownership  \n- disconnected from each other  \n- uncertain about the future  \n- tied to obligations that never shrink  \n- unable to rise  \n\nThe world we live in has systematically hollowed out real ownership:\n\n- homes are mortgaged for decades  \n- savings evaporate through inflation  \n- property taxes never rest  \n- businesses rely on debt instead of profit  \n- money loses value faster than you can earn it  \n- governments treat citizens as collateral  \n\nWe lost the foundation that allows life to grow.  \nWe lost the soil that lets people rise.\n\nResurrection is not just a theological truth — it’s an economic need.  \nAnd Bitcoin, surprisingly, speaks directly to this.\n\nThis article is about the renewal of ownership — the resurrection of sovereignty — and how Bitcoin restores the foundations that allow individuals, families, and communities to stand again.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Ownership Has Been Replaced by Perpetual Dependence\n\nWhat we call “ownership” today is often an illusion:\n\n- you “own” your home, but you pay property tax forever  \n- you “own” your car, but it’s financed for 7 years or more  \n- you “own” your savings, but inflation drains them  \n- you “own” your business, but it survives on credit  \n- you “own” your future, but you can’t stop working  \n- you “own” your time, but debt dictates your decisions  \n\nWe do not own.  \nWe rent.  \n\nFrom:\n\n- banks  \n- governments  \n- credit markets  \n- marketplaces  \n- employers  \n- inflation  \n\nWe rent everything — even the value we create with our labor.\n\nThis is why people feel spiritually and emotionally exhausted.  \nIt’s not weakness.  \nIt’s not laziness.  \nIt’s not “modern life.”\n\nIt’s the simple fact that we live in a system designed for:\n\n- extraction  \n- dependence  \n- control  \n- perpetual payment  \n\nIt is impossible to feel alive when your economic life is structured for slow death.\n\nThis is the world Bitcoin enters — not as a speculative asset, but as a **resurrection technology**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hard Money Is the Foundation of Real Ownership\n\nOwnership dies under fiat because:\n\n- money decays  \n- debt grows  \n- taxes never shrink  \n- interest compounds  \n- prices inflate  \n- savings evaporate  \n\nPeople cannot build anything solid in a world where the foundation is sand.\n\nBitcoin is the return to bedrock:\n\n- fixed supply  \n- incorruptible issuance  \n- time-based security  \n- decentralized validation  \n- global portability  \n- neutral rules  \n\nIn a system where money cannot be printed, real ownership becomes possible again:\n\n- savings retain value  \n- down payments become reachable  \n- mortgages shrink  \n- debt becomes temporary  \n- businesses grow from profit, not leverage  \n- families can plan generationally  \n\nBitcoin is not merely a store of value.  \nIt is the restoration of the **conditions** that make ownership real.\n\nIt provides the soil in which life can grow again.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Resurrection Requires a Reckoning — and Bitcoin Forces That Reckoning\n\nThe resurrection narrative begins with a death — the death of the old world, the old structures, the old powers.\n\nSimilarly, a Bitcoin transition exposes which parts of our economic system were alive and which were already dead:\n\n- zombie corporations that survive solely on cheap credit  \n- governments floating on unpayable debt  \n- banks dependent on artificial interest suppression  \n- real estate prices inflated far beyond reality  \n- entire sectors structured around financialization  \n\nBitcoin does not kill these systems.  \nIt simply refuses to lie for them.\n\nFiat economics is full of illusions:\n\n- artificial growth  \n- debt-funded prosperity  \n- inflated asset prices  \n- suppressed risk  \n- endless money printing  \n\nBitcoin reveals the truth.  \nAnd after the truth, resurrection becomes possible.\n\nYou cannot resurrect what you will not let die.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Resurrection of Trust\n\nIn a fiat world, trust has decayed.\n\nPeople trust:\n\n- institutions less  \n- their money less  \n- their pensions less  \n- their government less  \n- their employer less  \n- even their communities less  \n\nThis distrust is rational.  \nIt’s what happens when the rules constantly change.\n\nBitcoin resurrects trust not by appealing to emotions, but by anchoring the world in **unchangeable rules**:\n\n- 21M  \n- predictable issuance  \n- transparent ledger  \n- open verification  \n- no special access  \n- no manipulation  \n\nTrust becomes a property of the system, not the goodwill of its operators.\n\nThis is just the beginning.\n\nUnder Bitcoin:\n\n- local lending circles re-emerge  \n- community treasuries form  \n- families save generational wealth  \n- contracts become clean and enforceable  \n- people lend based on reputation, not algorithmic credit scores  \n- businesses seek investors, not creditors  \n- people help each other without financial intermediaries  \n\nTrust resurrects.  \nAnd with trust, ownership becomes safe again.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Resurrection of Families and Communities\n\nWhat destroys family stability?\n\n- debt  \n- inflation  \n- housing insecurity  \n- unstable jobs  \n- dependence on credit  \n- lack of savings  \n- perpetual financial stress  \n\nThese are not moral failings.  \nThey are structural failings.\n\nUnder a Bitcoin economy, families experience:\n\n- lower cost of living  \n- homes priced in real terms  \n- shorter mortgages  \n- growing savings  \n- more margin and rest  \n- less financial pressure  \n- more time together  \n\nStability resurrects.\n\nAnd stable families create stable communities:\n\n- more home ownership  \n- more local businesses  \n- more generational planning  \n- more mutual aid  \n- less dependence on the state  \n\nBitcoin does not fix everything.  \nBut it fixes the thing that makes everything else unstable.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Resurrection of Work\n\nFiat economics turns work into:\n\n- survival  \n- busywork  \n- compliance  \n- meaningless bureaucracy  \n- debt service  \n\nWork becomes something you *use* to stay afloat, not something you *offer* from creativity or calling.\n\nUnder Bitcoin, work shifts from survival to stewardship:\n\n- savings grow  \n- wages retain value  \n- debt becomes optional  \n- ownership becomes attainable  \n- individuals have margin for creativity  \n\nWork resurrects as vocation — not as servitude.\n\nPeople work because they are building something that lasts.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Resurrection of Wealth\n\nUnder fiat, wealth is a mirage.\n\n- Stocks go up because money is printed.  \n- Housing goes up because debt expands.  \n- Retirement accounts grow because inflation is hidden.  \n\nEverything is inflated — not enriched.\n\nReal wealth is:\n\n- assets that serve real needs  \n- savings that retain value  \n- homes owned outright  \n- families not in debt  \n- communities with margin  \n- businesses funded by profit  \n- governments that cannot print  \n\nBitcoin resurrects wealth by restoring **truth**.\n\nTruth about value.  \nTruth about risk.  \nTruth about cost.  \nTruth about ownership.\n\nWhen wealth is truthful, it can be generational.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Ownership as Resurrection\n\nIn a very real sense, ownership itself undergoes resurrection under Bitcoin.\n\nOwnership is:\n\n- authority  \n- stewardship  \n- responsibility  \n- freedom  \n- the ability to shape your world  \n\nOwnership dies in a fiat system because nothing is stable.  \nIt resurrects in a Bitcoin system because everything is grounded.\n\nJust as resurrection declares:\n\n> “Death is not the final word,”\n\nBitcoin declares:\n\n> “Debt is not the final word.  \n>  Inflation is not the final word.  \n>  Extraction is not the final word.  \n>  Manipulation is not the final word.”\n\nOwnership rises again — not as a privilege of the wealthy, but as a basic possibility for everyone willing to save, build, and steward wisely.\n\n---\n\n## 9. A New First Day\n\nSunday — the day of new creation — symbolizes the beginning of something that cannot be undone.\n\nBitcoin has that energy.  \nIt feels like first-day economics:\n\n- a new foundation  \n- a new trust structure  \n- a new relationship to money  \n- a new pattern for families  \n- a new path for nations  \n- a new possibility for freedom  \n\nThe world is aching for resurrection.  \nNot a political resurrection.  \nNot a technological resurrection.  \nAn economic one — grounded in truth, scarcity, fairness, and time.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t promise paradise.  \nBut it promises **integrity**.  \nAnd from integrity, life rises.\n\nThe resurrection of ownership begins with the resurrection of money.\n\nAnd from that foundation — everything else can rise.\n\n---",
