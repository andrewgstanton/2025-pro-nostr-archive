  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 11, 2025\n\nTwenty-four years ago today, America’s confidence was shaken as the Twin Towers collapsed in New York City. The shock of the attack led to grief, unity, and also fear. In that fear, the United States government enacted sweeping powers—the Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration. These measures were sold as temporary, but they remain with us nearly a quarter-century later.  \n\nThe choice to sacrifice freedom for security is an old temptation. Benjamin Franklin warned that those who trade essential liberty for temporary safety deserve neither. Yet in moments of crisis, even strong leaders often bend to the pressure of the state. After Sept 11, many on the right applauded the expansion of government, believing it was necessary to fight terrorism. Only years later did many realize that we had built an apparatus for mass surveillance, one that would be turned inward against citizens\n\nHonoring conservative leaders like Charlie Kirk requires us to wrestle with this history. Charlie has inspired countless young Americans to reject socialism, defend free speech, and embrace personal responsibility. These contributions matter. But true honor does not mean blind loyalty. It means helping leaders, even those we admire, remain anchored in principle.  \n\nConsider the lessons of the last two decades:  \n- The **Patriot Act** gave government the ability to monitor phone calls, financial records, and internet activity, all in the name of “safety.”  \n- The **NSA revelations by Edward Snowden** proved that mass surveillance extended to ordinary Americans with no connection to terrorism.  \n- The **COVID-19 pandemic** unleashed lockdowns, mandates, and digital tracking tools. Fear became justification for extraordinary control.  \n\nEach time, the rationale was “public safety.” Each time, the cost was liberty.  \n\nThe conservative movement today faces new choices: how to handle AI, biometric ID, border control, and domestic extremism laws. Will we again call for bigger government solutions that risk permanent overreach? Or will we insist that even in crises, liberty is non-negotiable?  \n\nCharlie Kirk has a platform in Turning Point that reaches millions. If it is used to reinforce true conservatism—limited government, personal freedom, sovereignty—it can help prevent the errors of the past. But if it is used to justify surveillance or authoritarian tools in the name of protecting America, he risks repeating the cycle that began on Sept 11.  \n\nHonoring Charlie therefore means reminding ourselves and our movement: the state is not our savior. No emergency justifies turning free citizens into monitored subjects. The real security of a nation comes from virtuous families, strong communities, and people who trust God more than government.  \n\nSept 11 was a national tragedy. But the deeper tragedy would be to allow fear to govern us permanently. To truly honor leaders like Charlie Kirk, we must guard against that temptation. We must refuse, once and for all, to trade freedom for surveillance.\n\n**Acknowledgement:** Written in memory of Sept 11, 2001—a day that reshaped America’s relationship with freedom and security.
