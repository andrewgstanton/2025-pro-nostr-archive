  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - May 20, 2025\n\nI didn’t take a course on “prompt engineering.” I didn’t memorize secret formulas or chase viral hacks.\n\nWhat I *did* do was treat it like a system.\n\nJust like in software:\n\n> **Write → Compile → Test → Debug → Repeat**\n\nWith AI, the loop feels just as familiar:\n\n> **Prompt → Output → Edit → Re-prompt**\n\nThat’s not magic. That’s engineering.\n\n***\n\nWhen someone asked me, *“How can you trust AI for anything serious?”*\\\nI told them: *“Same way we trust the internet — not because the network’s reliable, but because the protocol is.”*\n\nAI is no different. The key is building **systems around it**:\n\n* Multiple models if needed\n\n* Human-in-the-loop verification\n\n* Layered editing and real discernment\n\n***\n\n### It’s Not That Different From Other Engineering\n\nOnce you stop treating AI like a black box and start treating it like a tool, the whole experience changes.\n\nThe prompt isn’t a spell. It’s a **spec**.\\\nThe response isn’t a prophecy. It’s a **build**.\\\nAnd your discernment? That’s your **QA layer**.\n\n***\n\n### What I Actually Use It For\n\n* Brainstorming titles and refining headlines\n\n* Drafting posts that I shape and filter\n\n* Running content through for edge cases\n\n* Exploring theological or philosophical questions\n\nAnd yes — I want it to be **useful**. I *am* building to make a living, not just to make noise. But I don’t lead with monetization. I lead with **clarity** — and build toward sustainability.\n\n***\n\n### Final Thought\n\nIf you’re waiting for a course to teach you how to “do AI,” maybe just start by **building something real**. Test it. Edit it. Use it again. That’s engineering.\n\nShoutout to Dr. C (ChatGPT) for helping me articulate this.\n\nIf this post sparked anything for you, zap a few sats ⚡ — every bit helps me keep building with conviction.",
