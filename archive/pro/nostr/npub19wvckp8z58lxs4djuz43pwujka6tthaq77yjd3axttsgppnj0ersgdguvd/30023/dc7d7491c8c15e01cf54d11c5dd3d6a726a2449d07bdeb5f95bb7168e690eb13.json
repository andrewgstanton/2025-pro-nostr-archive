  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 3, 2025\n\nBehind the walls of today’s platforms, creativity withers. Voices are pruned, value is extracted, and trust erodes. But beyond the gates, something else is happening.\n\nSovereignty is not isolation — it is abundance. Builders are planting seeds of freedom in open soil. Hope belongs not to those who wait for permission, but to those who keep creating.\n\nThis is the garden without walls: a place where life, trust, and generosity can bloom again.\n\n👉 Full Paid article: *The Garden Without Walls: How Bitcoin Opens the Way to Human Flourishing*\n\n- 👉 Free Article 1 : *The Abundance of Sovereignty: Why Freedom Creates More, Not Less*\n- 👉 Free Article 2 : *Why Hope Belongs to Builders*\n\n🔒 **Full paid article available for 500 sats.**  Zap me and I’ll send it via encrypted DM while I finish building the automated unlock flow in Continuum.",
