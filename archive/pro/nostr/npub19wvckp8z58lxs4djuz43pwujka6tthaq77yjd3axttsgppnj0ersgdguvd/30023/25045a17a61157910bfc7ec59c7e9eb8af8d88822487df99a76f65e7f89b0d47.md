Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 27, 2025

There is a pattern that becomes obvious once you see it, and unsettling once you can’t unsee it.

Our educational systems, our platforms, and our creator economies increasingly share the same underlying logic: they are optimized to produce **highly competent, specialized, replaceable units** that can fit cleanly into an existing process.

The language differs.  
The outcomes do not.

### Education as preprocessing

Modern education often presents itself as a pathway to empowerment. And in many ways, it is. Skills matter. Literacy matters. Competence matters.

But beneath the rhetoric of “critical thinking” and “creativity,” the system is primarily designed to produce individuals who can be **integrated smoothly into established workflows**.

Students are:
- standardized
- credentialed
- tracked
- specialized early

Success is defined by how well someone *fits* — into a role, a department, a company, a pipeline.

The ideal graduate is not a sovereign agent.  
The ideal graduate is a **reliable component**.

This isn’t usually framed as dehumanization. It’s framed as “employability.”

But employability, in this context, often means *replaceability with minimal friction*.

### Platforms as behavioral factories

Digital platforms apply the same logic at scale.

Humans are no longer authors, participants, or citizens. They are “users.”

That word choice matters.

A user:
- consumes
- reacts
- is measured
- is optimized

A user does not initiate. A user does not govern. A user does not control the system they are inside.

Creators are told they are “building audiences,” but in reality they are feeding systems they do not control. They don’t decide how reach works. They don’t decide how virality happens. They don’t decide which forms of expression are amplified or suppressed.

Those decisions live upstream — in algorithms optimized for engagement extraction, ad inventory, and behavioral predictability.

Creators become **inventory**.
Users become **signals**.
Humans become **inputs**.

### The shared architecture

Education and platforms feel like separate domains, but they converge on the same output:

> Humans who are competent, compliant, and easily replaceable.

This isn’t because of malice.  
It’s because **agency is inefficient**.

Agency introduces variance.
Originality breaks pipelines.
Unstructured thought disrupts optimization.
People who don’t fit create friction.

So systems adapt humans instead of adapting themselves.

### Why this feels sickening once you see it

Once you notice this pattern, it’s hard not to feel a sense of quiet revulsion.

Not because every system is evil — but because the trajectory is clear.

Humans are increasingly valued not for their capacity to initiate, choose, and create meaning, but for:
- throughput
- compatibility
- predictability
- replaceability

The moment a system prefers components over agents, it stops serving human flourishing and starts managing human behavior.

Calling people “users” is simply the linguistic endpoint of that shift.

### Creators feel this first

Creators sit directly on the fault line.

They are encouraged to “be authentic,” but rewarded only when that authenticity:
- conforms to incentive gradients
- sustains engagement loops
- remains predictable
- doesn’t threaten the system’s metrics

Over time, creators don’t just change what they publish.
They change how they think.

This is not censorship in the traditional sense.  
It is **incentive-driven behavioral shaping**.

And it works precisely because it feels voluntary.

### The alternative is not chaos

Rejecting this model does not mean rejecting structure, coordination, or scale.

It means insisting on a different order of operations.

In a system that treats humans as agents:
- authorship precedes distribution
- drafts are allowed to exist privately
- publication is intentional, not reactive
- growth serves the work, not the other way around

Efficiency is not abandoned.
It is subordinated to agency.

### A line worth holding

There is a simple line that matters more than it appears:

**Systems should adapt to humans.  
Humans should not be adapted to systems.**

Once that line is crossed, everything downstream becomes easier to justify — and harder to undo.

Education becomes preprocessing.
Platforms become behavior factories.
Creators become components.

Seeing this pattern clearly doesn’t obligate anyone to tear everything down.

But it does obligate us to stop pretending the current trajectory is neutral.

Agency matters.
Authorship matters.
Ownership matters.

Not because they are nostalgic ideals — but because without them, we are no longer dealing with people at all.
