      "From a simple README to a fully sovereign publishing stack — this is the story of how Continuum was born. In just 60 days, we’ve built a local-first Nostr app with multi-identity support, publishing tools, and hosted dashboards — all without relying on logins, tokens, or platform permissions.  This was built with the help of AI — not to impress, but to liberate. Continuum is a sovereign publishing stack that puts control, identity, and freedom back where it belongs: with you."

  "content": "## From Idea to Infrastructure — A Sovereign Stack Emerges\n\n**May 24, 2025** — I made my first commit to what would become *Continuum*.  \nJust a simple README. No code yet. But the vision was forming.\n\n**Early June** — The codebase began to take shape. A local-first app built on Nostr.  \nNo logins. No passwords. Just sovereign identity, Bitcoin principles, and a refusal to rent space in someone else’s walled garden.\n\n**July 1** — Version 1.0.0 launched.  \nNot a prototype. Not a pitch deck.  \nA real, working app that could:\n- Load identities\n- Sign and publish Nostr events\n- Store your data — locally, and on relays you choose\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 In 60 Days, We’ve Built\n\n- **Local-first Nostr identity management**  \n  → No need to trust a browser extension or third-party wallet\n\n- **Publishing tools for notes, articles, and profiles**  \n  → With markdown support and NIP-05/NIP-07 integration\n\n- **Multi-identity support**  \n  → One user, many personas — each sovereign, each with its own `npub`\n\n- **Hosted mirror dashboards**  \n  → Read-only Continuum Pro views at `dashboard.mycontinuum.xyz/npub`\n\n- **LinkedIn ZIP import**  \n  → Turn a corporate resume into a sovereign profile, no OAuth needed\n\n---\n\n## 🟠 Why It Matters\n\nThis isn’t a Twitter clone. It’s not a new social app.  \n**Continuum is a sovereign publishing and identity framework.**  \nIt lets you:\n- Own your data  \n- Sign your voice  \n- Publish without asking permission\n\nIt’s not about hype. It’s about freedom.\n\n---\n\n## 🙋‍♂️ What’s Next\n\n- Add images, videos, and richer media to sovereign posts  \n- Build dashboards that mirror (and eventually edit) profiles like LinkedIn or GitHub  \n- Enable selective sharing, zaps-for-access, and sovereign service metadata\n\nBut for now — what we’ve already built works.  \nI don’t need to log into Primal to publish an article.  \nI don’t need anyone’s approval to create a new identity.  \nI can run Continuum locally.  \nI can push to the world.\n\nAnd that’s enough to keep going.",
