Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 22, 2025

Modern life feels strangely exhausting, even for people who work hard, manage their responsibilities, and act with integrity. Something is off. Something invisible but deeply structural. And it becomes clearest when you ask a deceptively simple question:

**Who actually owns anything?**

Not in the philosophical sense. Practically. Economically. Legally.

Because as soon as you tug on that thread, the entire architecture of the modern economic system begins to reveal itself — and what emerges is not a system built on production, innovation, or value creation, but a massive, interlocking *extraction engine*. The real “growth industry” of the world is rent seeking: capturing streams of income from people who have no choice but to pay.

This is the OS of the modern world.

And it is built into everything.

### **1. The Original Illusion: Ownership Without Sovereignty**

You can spend 30 years paying off a mortgage. You can maintain the property, improve it, raise children in it, pour yourself into it. And yet:

- If you fail to pay property taxes, you lose it.  
- If you fail to refinance when rates spike, you lose it.  
- If you fall behind on insurance requirements, you can lose it.  
- If zoning rules shift, you can lose the ability to use it as you want.  

And consider the absurdity: **even if you have no mortgage**, you still pay perpetual rent to the state in the form of property taxes.

This isn’t ownership.  
It’s a lease in disguise.

A lease that can never be paid off.

Every society that adopts property taxation eventually slips into this pattern: “ownership” becomes conditional, revocable, and dependent on continuous payment. You’re never fully sovereign over your land or home — you’re simply renting at a slower cadence.

### **2. Why the System Became Extractive**

Rent seeking didn’t emerge because people are greedy. Greed has always existed. What made it systemically possible — even inevitable — was the transition from sound money to elastic, credit-denominated money.

When money can be created:

- banks prefer long-term debt  
- governments prefer continuous revenue streams  
- institutions prefer predictable cash flows  
- investors prefer assets that generate rents  

And most importantly:

**money creation rewards those who hold assets, not those who produce value.**

Once you introduce an elastic money supply, the system naturally evolves toward:

- 30-year mortgages  
- now 40-year mortgages  
- and even 50-year mortgages  
- lifetime student debt  
- corporate buybacks funded by debt  
- governments rolling over interest payments indefinitely  

This isn’t accidental.  
This is what elastic money *optimizes for*.

It prefers *streams of extraction* over *bursts of productivity*.  

Productivity is risky.  
Debt is safe.  
Rents are safe.  
Income streams are safe.

When money is infinite, the incentive becomes clear:  
**own the thing that people have to pay for again and again, forever.**

### **3. The Strange Fact: Every Layer Extracts From Below**

Look at the stack:

- The bank extracts interest.  
- The state extracts property tax.  
- The insurance provider extracts premiums.  
- The bondholders extract yield.  
- The corporate landlords extract rent.  
- The HOA extracts dues.  

Even utilities now function like rent-extractors: mandatory, continuous, unending.

Every layer of modern life is built around *mandatory recurring payments*.  
That is the rent-seeking OS.

And the more leveraged the system becomes, the more it *requires* extraction simply to stay afloat.

This is why you see articles today celebrating the arrival of **50-year mortgages** as if they were progress. In reality, they represent nothing but the terminal stage of a system that cannot allow people to ever be debt-free.

If people became sovereign, the extraction engine would collapse.

### **4. Scarcity Isn’t Natural — It’s Manufactured**

We live on a planet overflowing with resources:

- enough land  
- enough food  
- enough labor  
- enough materials  
- enough ingenuity  

What we lack is not resources.  
We lack an honest monetary system.

Because an honest monetary system reveals abundance.  
A dishonest monetary system manufactures scarcity.

Scarcity is what keeps rents high.  
Scarcity is what keeps debt long.  
Scarcity is what keeps wages suppressed.  
Scarcity is what keeps people compliant.

If you can’t escape, you can be extracted from.

### **5. Bitcoin Breaks the Extraction Logic**

Now put Bitcoin into this picture — not as an ideology, but as a monetary fact.

Bitcoin does not allow:

- arbitrary credit expansion  
- infinite mortgages  
- perpetual rolling of debt  
- negative real rates  
- stealth taxation via inflation  

And because supply is fixed, debt must be:

- smaller  
- shorter  
- lower-risk  
- more conservative  
- and *actually paid back*  

This means rent seeking no longer works as a universal business model.  
The extraction engine loses power.  
The yield-farming of human lives becomes impossible.

On a Bitcoin standard:

- property taxes face political pressure  
- ultra-long mortgages disappear  
- lenders require skin in the game  
- credit becomes reputation-based, not collateral-based  
- communities, not megabanks, issue small loans  
- ownership becomes literal, not nominal  

Bitcoin forces reality back into economics.

### **6. A World Where Extraction Fades and Ownership Returns**

Imagine 10–15 years from now:

- Bitcoin is widely held.  
- Salaries are partially paid in sats.  
- Municipalities compete to reduce property taxes.  
- Mortgages are 10–15 years, not 50.  
- Down payments are higher because money cannot be conjured from nothing.  
- Communities form lending circles with Bitcoin multisig.  
- Houses are priced in a deflationary currency.  

Suddenly, people can actually pay things off.  
And once something is paid off, it stays paid off.

For the first time in modern memory, sovereignty becomes *achievable*.

This is why the existing system hates Bitcoin.  
It is not a competitor.  
It is an exit.

The world built on rent seeking cannot survive a world built on sovereignty.

### **7. The Extraction Engine Is Ending — Slowly, Then All at Once**

The global economy isn’t collapsing because people became irresponsible.  
It’s collapsing because the extraction OS can no longer run on reality.

- Wages are stagnating.  
- Debts are ballooning.  
- Property taxes are rising.  
- Mortgages are stretching into absurd lengths.  
- Prices are decoupling from incomes.  

This is not mismanagement.  
This is entropy.

When a system tries to extract more than reality can provide, it implodes.

Bitcoin isn’t just money — it’s a reset button.  
A return to truth.  
A return to sovereignty.  
A return to real ownership.

Not ownership conditional on taxes, inflation, or the whims of a central bank — but ownership rooted in time, work, and scarcity.

Real wealth, not synthetic wealth.  
Real value, not leveraged value.  
Real homes, not perpetual rent streams.

The extraction engine is grinding down.  
A sovereign future is beginning.
