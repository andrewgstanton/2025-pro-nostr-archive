Andrew G. Stanton - May 21, 2025

I recently released my first open-source tool:\
👉 [**nostr-signal-filter**](https://github.com/andrewgstanton/nostr-signal-filter)

It fetches and formats your **latest top-level Nostr note or long-form article**, cleans up any embedded links using **TinyURL**, and outputs a clean version ready for reposting to:

* LinkedIn

* Facebook

* X / Twitter

***

## ⚙️ Built for Simplicity

The stack is intentionally minimal:

* Python + WebSockets + Bech32

* TinyURL API for link shortening

* Dockerized CLI usage:

```
bash
```

CopyEdit

`docker run --rm -e PUBKEY=npub1yourpubkeyhere nostr-fetcher > latest.md`

From idea to working repo took **under 3 hours** — including debugging, Docker tweaks, README cleanup, and tagging a clean release.\
\
This most certainly would have taken much longer if I had done this all without ChatGPTs' help.\

🖼️ Example Output (`latest.md`)

## 🙌 Try It Yourself

If you're publishing on Nostr but still sharing on legacy platforms:

👉 [github.com/andrewgstanton/nostr-signal-filter](https://github.com/andrewgstanton/nostr-signal-filter)

* Clean output

* Easy to run

* Portable via Docker

All it needs is your `npub`.

## ⚡ Zap Me If You Found This Useful

If this tool saved you time — or if it sparked ideas for your own Nostr publishing stack —\
send a zap my way. I’m always looking to connect with other creators who value **signal > noise**.

## 🔭 Next Features (I’d Love Help With)

* Archive all notes + articles (not just the latest 50) to `archive.md`

* Function to shorten links in **any** text block

* Output `post.md` for any given Nostr event ID (not just latest)

* Optional API integration to post directly to LinkedIn or X

Built with ChatGPT’s help.\
Iterated. Published. Cross-posted.\
That’s proof of work.
