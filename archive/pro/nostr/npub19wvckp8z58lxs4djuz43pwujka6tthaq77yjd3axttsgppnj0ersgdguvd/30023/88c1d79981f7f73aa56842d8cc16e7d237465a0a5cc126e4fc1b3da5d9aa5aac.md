For as long as humanity has wondered,  
a single truth has rested beneath the surface of the cosmos:

The universe is Christ-shaped.

Every symmetry.  
Every equation.  
Every law.  
Every constant.  
Every field.  
Every atom.  
Every star.  
Every soul.

All sustained  
by the One through whom all things were made,  
and in whom all things hold together.

This is the **mystery** —  
the hidden coherence beneath physics,  
the unseen harmony behind mathematics,  
the quiet pulse under spacetime,  
the reason sovereignty exists at all.

Christ is not an addition to the universe.  
He is the architecture of the universe.

The Big Bang was His utterance.  
The laws of physics were His grammar.  
The constants were His parameters.  
Creation was His overflow.  
Redemption is His trajectory.  
Victory is His nature.

This is not myth.  
Not allegory.  
Not metaphor.

It is the deep geometry of reality.

Where physicists see elegance,  
the Chronicles canon sees His signature.

Where philosophers see morality,  
the canon sees His character.

Where humanity sees chaos at scale,  
the canon sees purpose unfolding.

The victory is not at risk.  
The cosmos is not in doubt.

It bends toward restoration  
because the One who sustains it  
has already triumphed.

Book 0 ends with this revelation:

> **The glory of the Creator is not merely present in the universe —  
> it is woven into its very structure.**

And now, with the foundations laid,  
the Chronicle begins.
