Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 22, 2025

Every few months, the headlines update the same depressing scoreboard:

- Global debt has hit another all-time high.  
- Government debt-to-GDP is “unsustainable.”  
- Interest payments now rival military or social spending.  

The numbers are now so large that they barely mean anything:

- **Hundreds of trillions** in global debt.  
- Hundreds of **percent of GDP** in some nations.  
- Debt growing *faster* than the real economy — everywhere.

At some point, a sane person asks:

> “Is it even possible to pay this off?  
>  And if not, what would it take to wipe the slate clean?”

Bitcoin people tend to answer with slogans like “just go on a Bitcoin standard.” But if we’re serious, we have to face the real question:

**Can we actually eliminate national and global debt using a Bitcoin standard — in any meaningful, honest way?**

Let’s walk through this carefully.

### 1. What “Debt” Really Is (and Isn’t)

When you hear “world debt,” it’s easy to imagine one big number we just need to “pay down.” But debt is not a single monolith.

Debt is a web of **claims**:

- Government bonds held by pensions, banks, funds, individuals.  
- Corporate bonds financing factories, buybacks, and acquisitions.  
- Mortgages, student loans, credit cards, car loans.  
- Cross-border sovereign debts — one country owing another.  

On the other side of every debt is a creditor who believes:

> “I am owed this number of units, with this interest, at this maturity.”

The problem isn’t just that the number is big.  
It’s that **the real economy cannot support both:**

- everyone getting paid  
- and everyone maintaining their current living standards  

**You can’t squeeze more real output from the same planet just because spreadsheets say so.**

So when we talk about “eliminating” world debt, we’re really asking:

- How do we **reconcile** these claims with reality?  
- Who takes losses?  
- In what unit do we settle?  
- And how do we prevent this from happening again?

This is where Bitcoin comes in.

### 2. The Fiat Playbook: Inflate, Roll, Pretend

Under the current system, there are only three ways to deal with unpayable debt:

1. **Inflate it away** – pay everyone back in units that buy less.  
2. **Default or restructure** – openly admit you can’t pay and negotiate haircuts.  
3. **Roll it forever** – issue new debt to pay the old debt and hope nobody notices.

We’ve been doing #3 with a mix of #1 for decades.  
#2 is politically taboo, because it’s honest.

Bitcoin does not magically introduce a fourth way.  
What it does is **force honesty**:

- You can’t print your way out.  
- You can’t hide risk in derivatives funded by central-bank backstops.  
- You can’t inflate debts away silently.

Under a Bitcoin standard, you are left with only **real options**:

- Pay in full (if you truly can — rare).  
- Restructure openly.  
- Default.  
- Or convert claims into something else (equity, revenue-sharing, etc.).

So the question becomes:

> Could a Bitcoin standard be the foundation for a *global debt workout*?

Yes. But not in the “no one feels pain” sense.

### 3. A Bitcoin Standard Is First About **Stopping** the Bleed

Before you can heal, you have to stop making the wound worse.

Step one in any Bitcoin-based reset would not be, “pay off everything in sats.”  
Step one would be:

- **Stop issuing new unbacked, fiat-denominated debt.**  
- Begin **anchoring** future obligations in hard money or in claims explicitly indexed to it.  
- Slowly shift the system from “infinite IOUs” to “finite assets.”

That looks like:

- Governments issuing fewer long-dated bonds, and more short, conservative ones.  
- Banks and pensions gradually accumulating Bitcoin as a reserve asset.  
- Local and national budgets being forced toward balance, because deficits can’t be magically monetized forever.  

This doesn’t eliminate existing debt yet.  
It stops the expansion of new fantasy promises.

Think of it as turning off the tap before you mop the floor.

### 4. The Hard Part: Converting and Restructuring the Old Debt

Now we come to the heart of your question: **Can we actually unwind the existing pile?**

There are a few realistic pathways in a Bitcoin transition:

#### Path A: Gradual Conversion + Haircuts

- Governments begin to **mark bonds to reality**, not fantasy.  
- Some bonds are bought back at a discount; others are rolled over into longer-term, lower-coupon instruments.  
- Portions of sovereign debt get swapped into:
  - equity-like claims (e.g., revenue bonds tied to specific projects), or  
  - claims on Bitcoin reserves held by the state.  

In this process:

- Creditors take losses in nominal terms.  
- But the **remaining value is more real**, backed by productive capacity and hard reserves.

This is similar to a **managed, global workout** — a controlled burn rather than wildfire.

#### Path B: Explicit Defaults + Bitcoin Re-Anchor

In more fragile nations:

- The state simply defaults.  
- Bonds go to zero or near-zero.  
- The country adopts Bitcoin (or a Bitcoin-backed currency) out of necessity.  
- Over time, new bonds can be issued — but on hard-money terms, with credible constraints.

This is brutal, but honest.  
The upside: once the default is over, the country can **rebuild on a clean foundation**.

#### Path C: Jubilee Mechanics

A Bitcoin-informed “debt jubilee” might look like:

- Capping the notional repayment of certain classes of debt (e.g., student loans, predatory consumer credit, usurious mortgages).  
- Using **Bitcoin reserves, tax receipts, or asset sales** to retire some obligations.  
- Forcing write-downs on creditors who knowingly participated in unrealistic lending.

In all cases, somebody takes a hit.  
There is no path where **all** existing claims get honored **in full** in a hard-money world.

And that’s the key point:

> Eliminating world debt does not mean “no one loses.”  
> It means “we stop pretending everyone can win from an impossible system.”

### 5. Could You Literally Pay It All Off in Bitcoin?

Let’s be blunt:

- If global debt is, say, \$300 trillion+,  
- And Bitcoin’s market cap in a mature standard is, say, \$50–100 trillion,  

…you cannot just “buy all the debt with Bitcoin” and make everyone whole.

Even if every sat were mobilized, the math doesn’t work without **massive re-pricing** of the claims.

Bitcoin’s role is not to serve as a magical payoff token.  
Its role is to:

- lock the future into hard constraints,  
- expose which claims are real and which were fantasy,  
- and prevent new layers of impossible promises from being piled on top.

So:

- **No**, we cannot fully pay off every existing fiat IOU with Bitcoin at par.  
- **Yes**, we can transition to a world where Bitcoin is the foundation — and old claims are restructured or extinguished.

### 6. What “Debt Elimination” Looks Like in Practice

In a Bitcoin standard world, “eliminating world debt” means:

1. **Debt-to-GDP ratios fall**, not because GDP explodes, but because nominal debts are written down, restructured, or defaulted.  
2. **New debt issuance becomes disciplined**, with lenders and borrowers sharing real risk (no central bank bailout assumptions).  
3. **Interest rates become real** — reflecting time preference and risk, not policy targets.  
4. **Savings re-emerge** as the primary way to fund investment, instead of leverage on leverage.  
5. **The total stock of outstanding debt shrinks** relative to real output and hard-money reserves.  

The “debt” doesn’t vanish in some mystical act.  
It is:

- recognized as unpayable,  
- reduced,  
- converted,  
- or wiped out.

And from that point on, Bitcoin prevents a repeat of the same insanity.

### 7. The Upside: A World With Less Debt and More Equity

One underappreciated side-effect of a Bitcoin standard is:

> The world moves from **debt-financed everything** → to **equity, savings, and shared-risk financing.**

Instead of:

- Governments funding everything through bonds,  
- Corporations gaming EPS via cheap borrowing,  
- Households maxing out credit to maintain fake lifestyles,  

…you get:

- Smaller, more targeted government projects funded transparently.  
- Companies relying more on retained earnings and equity.  
- Families buying homes with higher down payments, smaller mortgages, and real savings.  

The *volume* of promises shrinks.  
The *credibility* of each promise grows.

That’s what a post-debt world looks like:  
not the absence of all credit, but the end of debt as the default organizing principle of global finance.

### 8. So — Is It Possible?

If by “eliminating world debt” you mean:

> “Can we make every creditor whole in today’s terms, switch to Bitcoin, and keep everyone happy?”

**No.** That’s mathematically impossible.

If by “eliminating world debt” you mean:

> “Can we wind down this unpayable mountain of claims through a mix of defaults, restructurings, haircuts, and conversions — and then anchor the *future* in a hard-money standard so it can’t happen again?”

**Yes.**  
That’s not only possible — it’s probably inevitable in some form.

The system we have now is already failing.  
Bitcoin doesn’t *cause* the reckoning.  
It gives us a way to **rebuild after it** — on money that cannot be weaponized or inflated into oblivion.

Debt brought us here.  
Truth will have to take us out.  
Bitcoin is simply the monetary language of that truth.
