## Part 1: Earthbound Origins

- Bitcoin as the first neutral, sovereign money.
- Why decentralization ≠ sovereignty, but sovereignty demands decentralization.
- Earth as the “training ground” for resilience.

## Part 2: Lunar Nodes

- The Moon as Earth’s closest colony: ~1.3 second latency.
- Lightning + local block explorers = workable circular economy.
- How “first fruits” of sovereignty could be planted off-planet.

## Part 3: Martian Bitcoin

- Mars: 4–22 minutes delay → on-chain impractical for direct consensus.
- Martian colonies must run semi-independent Bitcoin layers.
- Sovereignty: Mars avoids becoming an Earth debt-colony by using Bitcoin.

## Part 4: Asteroid Belt Economics

- Mining asteroids = energy abundance (solar, nuclear, novel fuels).
- Proof-of-Work literally scales with cosmic energy capture.
- Colonies could “pay” each other with sats from asteroid resources.

## Part 5: Interplanetary Consensus

- No single “worldwide” mempool — instead, federations of local Bitcoin layers.
- Lightning + delay-tolerant networking as the glue.
- A future where humanity’s money works across planets because it’s grounded in physics, not politics.

## Part 6: The Outer Edges

- Beyond Mars: moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Oort Cloud, generation ships.
- Even where latency breaks direct interaction, Bitcoin can remain the ledger of truth — time-stamped by thermodynamics, not Earthly decrees.
