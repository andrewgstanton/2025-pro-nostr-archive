Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 24, 2025

The days blur together now.  
Morning coffee, afternoon check-ins, news cycles repeating themselves. The Chiefs game, a series called *Chief of War*. We fill the space with sound because the silence feels too final.

But even in that noise, another silence speaks — the kind that comes when the familiar begins to fade.

I notice the way sunlight hits the blinds at 5 p.m., how the room feels different with him resting there. The same walls, same furniture, same TV — but everything has shifted, as if the air itself knows something sacred is happening.

When light fades from familiar places, it doesn’t just disappear — it moves inside you. It teaches you how to see differently: how to find meaning in the mundane, how to sense eternity in the hum of an oxygen machine, how to love without needing words.

And maybe that’s what this whole season is — a slow learning to see what cannot be seen.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.

## Zaps Appreciated
If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.
