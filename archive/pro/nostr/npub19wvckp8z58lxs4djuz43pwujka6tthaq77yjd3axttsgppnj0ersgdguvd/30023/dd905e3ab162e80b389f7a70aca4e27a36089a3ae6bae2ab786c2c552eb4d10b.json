  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 6, 2025\n\nEvery epoch has its frontier.  In ours, the frontier is not geographic but cognitive.  The new colonizers do not raise flags—they raise notifications.  The red dot is the new imperial standard.  \n\nAttention is the currency of consciousness.  What you attend to becomes the shape of your world.  The tragedy of the digital age is not that we lack information but that we have ceded custody of attention to entities whose profit depends on scattering it.  \n\nTo live sovereignly is to repossess this territory.  Begin with mapping: where does your focus go in a day?  To what do you tithe your minutes?  Then fortify the borders.  Schedule sabbaths for the mind.  Disable alerts that mistake urgency for importance.  Guard the morning—the first light belongs to no corporation.  \n\nBitcoiners often speak of self-custody: *Not your keys, not your coins.*  The same principle governs the interior life: *Not your attention, not your soul.*  Custody of consciousness is harder than custody of keys because the thieves are charming.  They promise relevance, belonging, dopamine.  \n\nA sovereign person learns to say no even to good things.  The mind requires margin; creativity grows in the white space around obligation.  The saints of every age practiced it—fasting from noise to hear the still small voice.  \n\nReclaiming attention is not retreat; it is re-investment.  When the lens of perception is clear, we see the world again as invitation rather than feed.  We rediscover awe.  And awe is the beginning of wisdom—the recognition that some things are worthy of full attention and others are not.  \n\nGuard your mind as you would a garden.  Prune the weeds of trivia, water what is true, and share the fruit freely.  The harvest of focused attention is presence, and presence is the rarest wealth of our time.  \n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
