Andrew G. Stanton — Sept. 1, 2025

For centuries, society has drawn a hard line between workers and entrepreneurs. Workers sell their time for wages; entrepreneurs risk capital to build ventures. One is framed as labor, the other as ownership. One is treated as survival, the other as opportunity.

But this dichotomy is a product of the fiat system, not of human nature. Fiat money cements the gap between those who live paycheck to paycheck and those who accumulate capital. Inflation ensures that workers cannot easily cross the divide. Their wages erode too quickly, their savings melt away, and the chance to build capital is constantly postponed. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs and investors benefit from access to credit, asset inflation, and financial structures designed to favor capital over labor.

Bitcoin collapses this divide. By giving workers a way to store value without inflation, it turns every act of labor into a seed of entrepreneurship. The person stacking sats from a service job is no longer just a worker — they are preserving capital, building optionality, and laying the foundation for ownership.

This is revolutionary. For the first time in modern history, saving from wages is not a treadmill. It is capital formation. In fiat, saving is punished; in Bitcoin, saving is rewarded. The truck driver who saves 10% of his wages in Bitcoin is not only surviving — he is building wealth in the hardest form of capital humanity has ever known. The teacher stacking sats is not just a laborer; she is an entrepreneur in waiting, holding sovereign capital that can later fund new ventures, education, or a family enterprise.

Entrepreneurship under Bitcoin also looks different from the fiat model. In a fiat economy, entrepreneurship often requires gatekeepers: bank loans, venture capital, or government permits. Bitcoin removes those obstacles. A musician can sell directly to fans over Lightning. A writer can publish and receive sats instantly from readers across the world. A small shop can run a Lightning node and participate in global commerce without ever filling out paperwork for a payment processor. In each case, the line between “worker” and “entrepreneur” dissolves. Every worker can be a direct creator and owner, not just a hired hand.

This shift also reshapes what we mean by risk. In the fiat world, entrepreneurship is risky because it is highly leveraged. Startups raise capital by diluting ownership or taking on debt, gambling that future growth will outpace obligations. In the Bitcoin world, entrepreneurship can grow organically, powered by real savings and direct relationships with customers. The worker stacking sats is building resilience — a safety net that makes small risks possible. Over time, those small risks compound into enterprises.

Even culture begins to change. When labor and entrepreneurship converge, dignity is restored to both. Work is no longer reduced to survival wages, and entrepreneurship is no longer a privilege reserved for elites with access to capital markets. Every person becomes a sovereign agent, capable of both producing and owning, both laboring and creating.

We are only at the beginning of this shift. Today, it is still difficult for most workers to be paid directly in Bitcoin, and the fiat system still dominates global wages. But the logic of Bitcoin is already clear. Each person who saves in sats is living in two economies at once: the fiat economy of erosion and the Bitcoin economy of sovereignty. Over time, the latter will win, because it is built on fairness rather than extraction.

The old dichotomy between workers and entrepreneurs was always artificial. Human beings are both by nature: we labor, and we create. What kept them apart was the monetary system that punished one and privileged the other. Bitcoin makes them one again.

In a Bitcoin world, every worker is also an entrepreneur. Every hour of labor can become capital. Every act of creation can be preserved. The false divide collapses, and what remains is the truth: human beings are sovereign creators, meant to both work and build, to both earn and own.
