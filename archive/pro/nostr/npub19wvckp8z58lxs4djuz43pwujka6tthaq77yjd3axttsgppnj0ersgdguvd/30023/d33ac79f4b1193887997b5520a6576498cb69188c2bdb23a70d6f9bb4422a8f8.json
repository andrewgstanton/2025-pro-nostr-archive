  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 9, 2025\n\n### The Myth of Control  \n\nWe live in a culture addicted to control.  \nControl of outcomes. Control of narratives. Control of people. It’s how empires are built and how individuals lose their souls.  \n\nFrom childhood we’re trained to tighten our grip — to plan, to optimize, to fight for our place in a world of competition. But grace begins where control ends.  \n\nChrist didn’t overthrow Rome; He overcame death. His path was not domination but descent — from heaven to earth, from power to humility, from throne to cross. Every rung downward was an act of infinite strength disguised as surrender.  \n\n---\n\n### The Strength Hidden in Weakness  \n\nThe world measures strength by noise. God measures it by endurance.  \nThe world exalts those who never bend; God crowns those who break and are remade.  \n\nEvery act of surrender is misunderstood. To the unspiritual eye, Jesus looked weak when He refused to fight. But what looked like weakness shattered the world’s logic of fear.  \n\nThat’s the irony of the Kingdom: you win by losing, you rise by falling, you conquer by forgiving.  \n\nWhen we yield, we stop confusing resistance with righteousness. We start seeing the battle differently — not as a war to dominate, but a call to transform.  \n\n---\n\n### Surrender as Proof of Trust  \n\nTrue faith doesn’t demand outcomes. It entrusts them.  \nThat’s why surrender is the highest form of worship — it says, “I trust You even when I don’t understand You.”  \n\nEach time you release your grip on what you can’t control, you make room for resurrection.  \nThis isn’t passivity. It’s alignment.  \n\nIt’s the same dynamic that makes Bitcoin resilient: there’s no central authority forcing it forward — only consensus built on trust in truth. The Kingdom works the same way. Love and faith are its consensus layer.  \n\n---\n\n### The Yielding That Liberates  \n\nWhen you stop clinging to your own plan, something miraculous happens: peace.  \nYou stop reacting and start responding. You stop defending your identity and start discovering it.  \n\nEvery surrender is a seed.  \nAnd every seed must fall into the ground and die before it bears fruit.  \n\nThat is the law of life — written into nature, echoed in Bitcoin’s halving cycles, and fulfilled perfectly in the cross. Strength looks like surrender because only love that yields can multiply.  \n\nSo rest, release, and remember: your proof-of-work is not your striving, but your trust.  \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
