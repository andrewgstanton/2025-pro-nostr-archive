Stanton - Dec. 11, 2025\n\n*Recovered from Relay Archive #1127-A  \nTimestamp: Pre-Launch, Pilgrim-1*\n\n**THE PILGRIM CHARTER**\n\n> “No authority may claim dominion over a human mind, a human conscience,  \n> or a human future — not on Earth, not beyond it.”\n\nThese were the opening lines of the Pilgrim Charter, the founding document drafted by the thirty-two members of the first sovereign launch team on the eve of departure.\n\nIt was not a declaration of rebellion.  \nIt was a declaration of *jurisdiction*.\n\nEarth’s tightening lattice of registries, licensing bureaus, orbital accords, and early space-compliance protocols had begun to suffocate independent research. What began as “safety guidelines” metastasized into a bureaucracy of permissions.\n\nThe Pilgrim team realized something quietly frightening:\n\n**If humanity needed permission to leave Earth, then humanity no longer owned its future.**\n\nAnd so they wrote the Charter.\n\nIt was posted to a sovereign relay — one outside the jurisdictional mesh of national networks — and replicated across thousands of nodes operated by ordinary citizens. In that moment, the Charter became *uncensorable*. No one authority could retract the words. No clerk could void the signatures.\n\nThe final line of the document reads:\n\n> “Let sovereignty expand with us — or be left behind.”\n\nThe next morning, Pilgrim-1 launched.\n\nAnd Earth was never the same.",
