Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 30, 2025

There was no sound in the void—  
for sound requires air,  
and there was no air.

Yet all of creation remembers the moment  
when the Creator breathed the first note.

It was not a bang.  
It was **a beginning**.

A single, sovereign tone  
that carried within it:

- all the laws of physics  
- all constants and symmetries  
- all the matter that would ever be  
- all the energy that would ever burn  
- all the histories that would ever unfold  
- all the lives that would ever awaken  

The Song was:

- pure  
- mathematical  
- beautiful  
- intentional  

As it rang out, spacetime unfurled like fabric.  
Light burst forth from the command:  
**“Let there be.”**

Galaxies formed as the harmonics deepened.  
Stars ignited as chords layered.  
Worlds took shape as melodies interwove.

This is the true nature of the cosmos:

> **Creation is music made visible.**

Every atom hums with remembrance.  
Every quantum field resonates with purpose.  
Every heartbeat echoes the first note.

The Song still plays.  
We are part of its unfolding.
