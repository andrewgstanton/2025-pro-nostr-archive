Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 25, 2025

Letting go is not a feeling. It’s a discipline.

We think it will come naturally when the time is right — that somehow, when we’ve healed enough, we’ll be ready to release the past. But it rarely works that way.

Letting go must be practiced, not waited for. It’s a daily surrender — an act of trust that says, “God, I can’t carry this anymore, and I’m not supposed to.”

Every attachment — to a person, an outcome, a story about who we were — binds us to what no longer exists. The longer we hold, the heavier it becomes.

Sometimes God pries our fingers open through loss. Other times, He waits for us to unclench willingly. But always, the point is freedom.

Release is not forgetfulness. It’s faith in motion — the belief that something new can grow where the old has fallen away. It’s the courage to bless what was without needing to resurrect it.

Letting go does not erase love. It purifies it.

It transforms possession into gratitude, memory into wisdom, and grief into strength. And in that transformation, we begin to taste eternity — the state where nothing is lost, only fulfilled.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
