Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 22, 2025

There was no countdown on Isaac Bell’s screen.

The public saw launches as theater — a ribbon of flame, a tremor in the ground, a line of light rising into the thin upper air. But Bell’s world was quieter. It had no cameras. It had no applause. It had no noise at all, except the soft mechanical clicking of compliance machinery that never slept.

He sat under fluorescent light that had been replaced so many times it no longer felt like light. It felt like a kind of weather.

On the wall behind him hung a framed placard with a sentence that had outlasted four directors, three reorganizations, and a national commission that had sworn it would “restore trust.”

**LAUNCH AUTHORIZATION IS A PUBLIC SAFETY FUNCTION.**

Bell had never agreed with the sentence. Not fully.

Not because safety didn’t matter. But because the sentence pretended safety was the point.

Safety was not the point.

The point was containment.

The file was waiting.

He opened it without ceremony.

**CIVIL LAUNCH MANIFEST — REQUEST FOR DEPARTURE AUTHORIZATION**  
Departure Window: 206.4 hours  
Payload: 12,870 kg  
Crew: 4  
Sponsor: Independent Consortium (registered)  
Destination: Lunar Transfer Node / Freeport Corridor  
Justification: “Research, trade, family reunification”

Bell read the name of the sponsor twice. He had seen it before — always at the edges, always just clean enough to be technically legitimate. The sort of group that used proper nouns and legal counsel like armor. The kind of people who believed paperwork was reality.

He clicked through the manifest.

Fuel systems: compliant.  
Thermal controls: compliant.  
Radiation shielding: compliant.  
Navigation: compliant.  
Flight plan: compliant.  
Insurance: compliant.

On paper, it was a launch.

And in a normal world, it would have been approved.

But Bell did not live in a normal world.

He lived in the narrowing window between a civilization that still pretended departure was a right and a civilization that had quietly decided it was a privilege.

He scrolled down to the attachment list.

- Economic Impact Analysis (Federal Template)  
- Departure Risk Projection (Tier 3)  
- Social Stability Memo (Interagency)  
- Continuity Advisory — CLASSIFIED ADDENDUM  
- “Community Care Statement” (new requirement)

The last one was new, and Bell hated it.

It had been added in the wake of the “compassion hearings,” when public outrage had forced the agencies to pretend the restrictions weren’t restrictions. When the administrators began speaking about launches like triage, and triage like moral virtue.

Bell clicked the Community Care Statement.

It was only three paragraphs. It used the new language — the soft language that had entered everything like mold.

*We acknowledge that departure impacts those who remain.*  
*We affirm our commitment to non-extractive participation.*  
*We recognize the importance of equitable opportunity and shared sacrifice.*

Bell didn’t flinch. He didn’t scoff. He didn’t roll his eyes.

He simply felt tired.

Because he knew what the statement was doing.

It wasn’t for care. It was for guilt.

It was to make the ones who left speak as if leaving were a moral offense.

And it was to make the ones who stayed feel justified in resenting those who refused to drown with them.

Bell closed the statement and opened the classified addendum.

That was where truth lived now — in the documents no one could quote.

The addendum was short.

**CONCERN: SECONDARY DEPARTURE CASCADE RISK.**  
**NOTES:** Approval likely triggers additional non-compliant attempts within 72 hours. Sponsor has indirect ties to prior unauthorized exit attempts (see Appendix C).  
**RECOMMENDATION:** Deny.

Bell stared at the word *cascade*.

He had seen cascades.

They were not theories.

The first cascade had happened ten years earlier, when a single high-profile financier had slipped through a loophole. The launch itself had been legal. The effect had not.

It was not the wealthy leaving that had broken the system. It was the signal.

The poor did not riot because the rich departed. They rioted because the rich proved departure was possible.

A system can survive injustice longer than it can survive exposed exit.

Bell looked down at the “Deny” button.

It was a simple thing. It had no weight on the screen.

But it had weight in the world.

There were four names on this manifest.

Four lives. Four families. Four private histories that would never appear in any report.

Bell clicked the crew list.

- Captain: Maren Ochoa  
- Navigator: Daniel Cross  
- Engineer: Hye-Jin Park  
- Medical: Elias Trent

He paused on the medical officer.

Not because the man mattered more than the others, but because Bell recognized the pattern.

The last five manifests that had crossed his desk had included medical personnel.

People were no longer leaving to get rich. They were leaving to build a world that didn’t rot.

That was what made the restriction era so morally dangerous.

The early escapes had been easy to condemn. They were selfish. They were cowardly. They were opportunistic.

But now?

Now the departures looked like conscience.

Bell rubbed his thumb against the edge of his desk, a private habit he’d developed years ago. It was not nervousness. It was calibration. A way of anchoring himself in something physical when the work threatened to become abstract.

He remembered a conversation from earlier that week.

A junior analyst — bright, sincere — had asked him, almost timidly, whether he ever felt like a villain.

Bell had not answered immediately. He had waited until the question had room to breathe.

Then he said, “Villains enjoy it.”

The analyst had blinked.

Bell had continued, quieter: “If someone must say no, it should be someone willing to be hated.”

That had been the truest thing he knew.

And it had not made him feel better.

Bell opened the accountability log.

Every denial required a reason. Not because the system loved accountability, but because accountability was how the system protected itself.

If a denial was challenged later, Bell would be the face in the record.

Not the director. Not the commission. Not the interagency board. Not the elected officials who spoke about “public care” while building exit corridors for their own families.

Bell would be the signature.

He began typing.

**DENIAL RATIONALE:**  
Launch manifest is technically compliant; however, based on continuity advisories and prior corridor instability, authorization presents unacceptable risk of secondary cascade events and non-compliant departure attempts. Denial issued pursuant to Emergency Departure Restriction Framework (EDRF) Section 4.2 (“Preventative Denial Authority”) and Interagency Continuity Directive 19-B.

He stopped.

He could have added more. He could have embellished. He could have used the language of virtue.

But Bell did not decorate.

He wrote what would stand up in a hearing.

He wrote what would survive when the people who drafted the policy denied ever drafting it.

He clicked “Attach Supporting Evidence.”

He attached the classified addendum.

He attached the cascade projections.

He attached the interagency directive.

Then he hovered over the deny button again.

There was a softness in the room — not peace, but stillness. The kind of stillness that arrives before a heavy thing falls.

In another life, Bell might have been a different kind of man. He had once been an engineer — not formally, but in his bones. He liked systems that could be understood. He liked problems that could be solved.

But he had been pulled into launch authorization during the early compliance years, when the agencies still spoke of “temporary restriction” and “managed transition.” He had told himself, then, that he was protecting order until legitimacy could be restored.

He had believed, for a time, that order and legitimacy were the same.

Now he knew they weren’t.

And yet he still sat here.

He still did the work.

Because the alternative was worse.

Not because Bell worshiped control, but because he had seen what happened when the gates opened without preparation.

He had seen food systems collapse.  
He had seen infrastructure failures cascade into riots.  
He had seen ordinary people become mobs.

Bell had always feared collapse more than tyranny.

He was not alone in that.

He clicked “Deny.”

A small dialog box appeared.

**CONFIRM DENIAL — CIVIL LAUNCH MANIFEST**  
This action will notify sponsor and initiate appeal window.  
Proceed?

Bell clicked “Proceed.”

There was no sound.

No drama.

Only the quiet conversion of possibility into refusal.

He watched the system generate a denial code.

A line of text appeared:

**DENIAL ISSUED — AUTHORITY: I.R. BELL — TIMESTAMP 2044-11-07 21:16:03**

That was all.

A name.

A time.

A sealed door.

Bell leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.

He did not pray.

Not because he didn’t believe in God, but because he did not know how to speak to Him anymore without feeling like a liar.

He had once believed duty was holy.

Now he wasn’t sure.

He was sure only of this: if he stopped doing the job, someone else would do it — someone with less hesitation.

Someone who would enjoy the power.

Someone who would deny with contempt.

Bell denied with sorrow.

He told himself that mattered.

Sometimes it did.

Sometimes it didn’t.

A new notification appeared.

**INCOMING MANIFEST — PRIORITY REVIEW**

Bell exhaled slowly, as if to let something leave his body that wouldn’t leave.

Then he opened the next file.

Outside the building, somewhere beyond the concrete and the paperwork and the long thinning air, the world kept turning.

And somewhere beyond Earth, the corridors waited.

Not for permission.

For the day permission would no longer matter.
