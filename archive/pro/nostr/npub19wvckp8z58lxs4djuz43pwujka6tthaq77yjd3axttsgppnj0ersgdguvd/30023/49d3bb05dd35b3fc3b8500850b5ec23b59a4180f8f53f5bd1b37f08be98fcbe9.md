Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 27, 2025

They didn’t call it Thanksgiving anymore, not officially.  
The Lunar Council had a different term for it—*Commemoration Day*—a neutral phrase, engineered to fit across the diverse enclaves scattered from Shackleton Port to Freeport’s southern dome.

But settlers are stubborn.  
And memories travel strangely across centuries, surviving where institutions fail.

So on the 27th day of the 11th cycle, a handful of the Freeport homesteaders gathered around a long steel table in Dome 3. There was no turkey, no cranberry sauce, no mashed potatoes. Protein blocks and hydroponic greens, yes. A thin sliver of lab-grown salmon if you were lucky. But they all knew what it *meant*.

A day to breathe.

A day to remember that survival had never been guaranteed — not in the Old World, not in the lunar mines, not in the quantum-flux storms that sometimes rippled through the entanglement arrays.

And for a strange, almost haunting moment, it felt like home.

### The Mayflower Echo

Aria Stanton (no relation to the author) stood at the head of the table. A historian by training, she often felt like she was living inside her own research: the early settlers of Plymouth, the fragile peace with the Wampanoag, the impossible calculations that shaped survival on foreign ground.

She knew the contradictions:  
how Christian hope had intertwined with failure, fear, miscommunication, and, later, devastation.

But she also knew the deeper truth — beneath the conflict, beneath the centuries of interpretation and reinterpretation:

People survive by giving thanks.

Even if imperfectly.  
Even if the world they arrived in was already wounded.  
Even if they misunderstood more than they knew.

### A New Lakota Presence

Two representatives from New Lakota Colony had joined the gathering:  
Tashunka and Wiyohinyan, emissaries of the Free Peoples Treaty.

Their ancestors, centuries earlier, had never crossed paths with the original Mayflower settlers.  
Different tribes, different landscapes, different histories.

Yet here they were in Dome 3, sharing protein-block casseroles under a sky made of reinforced aluminum.

History folds on itself in strange ways.

Tashunka lifted his cup—filled with recycled water filtered through ten kilometers of lunar regolith—and said quietly:

> “Every people has a story of crossing.  
>  What matters is what you honor when you arrive.”

Aria felt those words in her chest.

Not empire.  
Not domination.  
Not extraction.

But honor.  
Memory.  
Gratitude.

### Bitcoin Beneath The Surface

Every homestead on Freeport ran on sats.

Energy.  
Food credits.  
Medical supplies.  
Docking fees.  
Habitation tax.  
Water rights.

All settled by lightning-fast transactions across the Freeport Mesh.  
Even the entanglement array — the heart of the colony’s instantaneous matter-transfer experiments — had been partially funded by sovereign Bitcoin contributions from across Earth and Mars.

Old sovereignty had been political.  
New sovereignty ran on hard money.

Hard money required hard truth.

And hard truth required communities that remembered where they had come from.

### The Prayer

At the end of the meal, Aria closed her eyes.  
Not everyone prayed anymore.  
But some rituals transcend belief.

She whispered:

> “Lord of life,  
>  Keeper of the stars,  
>  We thank you for the ground beneath us,  
>  even when it is not the ground of our birth.  
>  We thank you for the people beside us,  
>  even when our ancestors walked different paths.  
>  We thank you for the hope within us,  
>  even when the world is fragile.”

No one objected.  
On the Moon, gratitude was practical, not ideological.

### A New Holiday

By the time the dome lights dimmed, a new rhythm was forming.

They weren’t reenacting Earth traditions.  
They were forging something new — something that preserved the best parts of the old world without repeating the violence that had once defined it.

It wasn’t the Mayflower.  
It wasn’t Plymouth.

But it was a beginning.

And beginnings, like gratitude, echo across centuries.
