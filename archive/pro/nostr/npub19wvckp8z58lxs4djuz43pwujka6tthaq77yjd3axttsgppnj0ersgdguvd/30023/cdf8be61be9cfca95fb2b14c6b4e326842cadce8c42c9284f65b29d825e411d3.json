  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - August 25, 2025\n\nMost people treat Bitcoin as just another trade — buy, sell, speculate, and hope to outpace fiat.\n\nI don’t. I treat it as my treasury. Trades are temporary. Treasury is forever.\n\nIn the full article, I share:\n\n- Why treasury ≠ trade\n- The weekly sweep rule that builds sovereignty by habit\n- How denominating in BTC changes the entire game\n\n**🔒 Full article available for 500 sats.** Zap me and I’ll send it via encrypted DM while I finish building the automated unlock flow in Continuum.",
