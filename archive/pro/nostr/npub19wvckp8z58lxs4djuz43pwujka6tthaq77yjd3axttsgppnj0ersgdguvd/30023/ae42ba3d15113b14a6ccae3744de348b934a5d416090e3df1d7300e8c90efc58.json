      "As Memorial Day invites sober reflection on freedom and sacrifice, I pause to honor what was given — and consider what I’m building toward. This week I head to Bitcoin 2025 not just as a Bitcoiner, but as someone seeking to live with conviction. This is a call to remember the cost of liberty and to build systems rooted in truth, transparency, and work that lasts.\n"

  "content": "Today I pause — not to celebrate, but to remember.\\\nMemorial Day is a reminder that freedom always comes at a cost. Not theoretical. Not digital. Real. Blood-bought. Passed down.\n\nI didn’t earn the liberties I have. Someone else paid for them.\\\nThe least I can do is *steward them well* — in how I live, build, and speak.\n\nTomorrow, I head to Bitcoin 2025.\\\nI go not just as a Bitcoiner, but as someone who believes Bitcoin, when rightly understood, calls us back to **truth**, **cost**, and **accountability**.\\\nNot magic internet money. Not another tech trend.\\\nBut a reckoning.\n\nSo I walk into this week with both gratitude and resolve:\n\n* Grateful for those who gave their lives.\n\n* Grateful for the freedom to write, build, and think out loud.\n\n* Resolved to use that freedom wisely — and to build systems that don't require bloodshed to sustain them.\n\nLet’s build what lasts.\\\nLet’s remember what was paid.\\\nLet’s walk into Bitcoin 2025 with clear eyes and full hearts.\n",
