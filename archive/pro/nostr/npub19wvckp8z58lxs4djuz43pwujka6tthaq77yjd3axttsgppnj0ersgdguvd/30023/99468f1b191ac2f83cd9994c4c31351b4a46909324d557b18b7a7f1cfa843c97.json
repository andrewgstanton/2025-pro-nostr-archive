Stanton - Aug. 10, 2025\n\n## **Preface**  \nThis article uses Bitcoin as a *modern parable* to illustrate Biblical truths found in the Victorious Gospel.  \nIt is not an endorsement of Bitcoin as a religion, a source of salvation, or a rival to Christ.  \nChrist alone redeems and restores.  \nBitcoin is simply a contemporary example that mirrors certain Kingdom principles — especially the idea of “first fruits” leading to a full harvest — and is used here as a teaching analogy.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Victorious Gospel proclaims that *all will be drawn to Christ in due time*.\nBitcoin is a decentralized, incorruptible form of money.\n\nAt first glance, they’re unrelated.\nBut look closer, and you’ll see the same divine pattern in both:\n\n- **An unshakable foundation**\n- **First fruits (early receivers)**\n- **A guaranteed full harvest**\n\nThis is not a claim that Bitcoin is a new religion or a source of salvation.\nChrist alone redeems, saves, and restores. Bitcoin is simply a *tool* — and a remarkably vivid modern parable — illustrating how truth, freedom, and inevitability unfold over time.\n\n---\n\n## Election as “First Fruits”\n\nIn the Victorious Gospel, **election** doesn’t mean God saves some *instead* of others. It means He calls some *before* others, for the sake of others.\n\nThe “elect” are the **first fruits** of the harvest (Romans 8:23; 1 Corinthians 15:20) — the first to see, believe, and embody the reality that will one day embrace the whole world.\n\n> **“And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”**  \n> — John 12:32\n\nBeing among the first fruits is a gift — and a responsibility. It means carrying the light of Christ now so that others can see it when their time comes.\n\n---\n\n## Bitcoin’s First Believers\n\nBitcoin has its own “first fruits” — the early adopters who saw its truth before the masses did:  \nthat money could be trustless, incorruptible, and borderless.\n\nLike the elect in the Gospel, early Bitcoiners weren’t chosen because they were *better*, but because they were *early*. Their role was to prove, protect, and demonstrate a reality others would later discover.\n\nBitcoin’s protocol, like God’s plan, unfolds over time — not instantly, but inevitably.  \nBut unlike God’s plan, Bitcoin is not perfect, eternal, or divine.  \nIt’s just one more reflection in creation that can help point us back to the Creator.\n\nAnd just as the elect are a sign of God’s coming harvest, early Bitcoiners are a sign of what will eventually become global adoption — though one points to eternal redemption, and the other is only a temporal tool.\n\n---\n\n## The Shared Blueprint\n\n| Pattern                 | Victorious Gospel                               | Bitcoin                                     |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Foundation**          | Christ’s finished work                          | Bitcoin’s incorruptible protocol            |\n| **First Fruits**        | The elect — called now for the sake of others   | Early adopters — called to prove and protect|\n| **Full Harvest**        | All drawn to Christ in due time                  | Global adoption over time                   |\n| **Opposition**          | Religious/world systems resisting grace         | Governments/banks resisting sovereignty     |\n| **Mission of the Early**| Shine light, reveal truth, live the Kingdom now | Educate, build, protect the network         |\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Sidebar: Why This Is Not a Religion\n\n- **Christ Alone Saves.** Bitcoin cannot redeem souls, forgive sins, or restore creation.  \n- **Bitcoin Is a Tool.** It’s part of creation, not the Creator — subject to His sovereignty.  \n- **No Worship, No Bowing.** We don’t pray to Bitcoin or ascribe divine attributes to it.  \n- **Guard Against Counterfeits.** Just as some futurists talk about worshiping AGI after the “Singularity,” we reject any created thing — whether code, currency, or machine — being elevated to godhood.\n\nBitcoin is simply one more reflection of God’s principles in action: truth, transparency, and incorruptibility. Its purpose here is to *illustrate* spiritual truths, not to replace them.\n\n---\n\n## The Subtle Idol of Optics\n\nIdolatry doesn’t always look like bowing before a statue.  \nSometimes it looks like protecting an image, curating a brand, or polishing a public persona — especially in religious settings.\n\nWhen “looking right” becomes more important than *being* right with God, we’ve made an idol out of optics.\n- “Excellence” can mask pride.  \n- “Protecting the witness” can mask fear of being disliked.  \n- “Unity” can mask the avoidance of truth.\n\nThe Victorious Gospel breaks that cycle: we are already fully accepted in Christ, not because of how we appear, but because of His finished work. That frees us to live honestly, even if it shatters the image others expect.\n\n---\n\n## Performance Leaders vs. Confessional Servants\n\n**Performance Leaders**:\n- Project strength, certainty, and polish at all times\n- Avoid public confession of weakness to “protect influence”\n- Measure success by optics, numbers, and applause\n\n**Confessional Servants**:\n- Admit their own insufficiency openly\n- Boast only in Christ’s strength displayed through weakness\n- Measure success by faithfulness to truth, regardless of reception\n\nThe first group can inspire admiration — but it’s admiration for *them*.  \nThe second group inspires faith — faith in *Christ*.\n\n---\n\n## Final Word: All Glory to God\n\nI am wretched and self-centered to the core.  \nIt is **only Christ in me** that is the light I share.  \nMy own righteousness is filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).\n\nIf there is anything good, true, or helpful in my words, it is because of Him.  \nThe role of the “first fruits” is not to showcase themselves, but to be living proof of His mercy — pointing toward the full harvest to come, when all will be drawn to Him.\n\nThis article was prayerfully shaped with the assistance of “Dr. C” (an AI language model) as a writing tool — but the insight, conviction, and truth belong to Christ alone.",

      "This article draws a parallel between the Victorious Gospel’s teaching of “first fruits” and the emergence of Bitcoin, showing how both follow a pattern of unshakable foundation, early adopters, and inevitable full reach. It explores the role of the “elect” as living witnesses, warns against modern forms of idolatry — from image management to AI worship — and grounds the whole message in humility, giving all glory to Christ."
