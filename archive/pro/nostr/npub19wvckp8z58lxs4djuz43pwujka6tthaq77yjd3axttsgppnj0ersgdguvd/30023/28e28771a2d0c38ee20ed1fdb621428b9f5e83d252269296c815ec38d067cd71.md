I'm now hosting project-related images — including changelogs, diagrams, and screenshots — directly at [https://mycontinuum.xyz/images/](https://mycontinuum.xyz/images/), as well as images used for this and future articles.  This keeps my Nostr articles lightweight and sovereign, without relying on Imgur or third-party services.

Below is a quick test using `img` tags with inline sizing to control the display.

## 📸 Dashboard View (v1.0.0)

This screenshot shows the MyContinuum dashboard at version 1.0.0, displaying a locally hosted note and article timeline.

## 🗂 Schema View (v1.0.0)

This is the full SQLite schema used in the local version of MyContinuum as of v1.0.0. It includes support for notes, articles, DMs, relays, profiles, replies, likes, and reposts — all stored locally.

More to come soon as I continue refining both the public and pro versions of MyContinuum.
