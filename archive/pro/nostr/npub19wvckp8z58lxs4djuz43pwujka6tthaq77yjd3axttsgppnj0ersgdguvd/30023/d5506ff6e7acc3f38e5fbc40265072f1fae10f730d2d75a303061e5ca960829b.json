      "summary",
      "This post explores how work transforms in a deflationary economy inspired by Bitcoin. Instead of chasing endless hustle, workers are freed to choose meaningful, purpose-driven labor that endures. It contrasts today’s inflationary “race to keep up” with a slower, more deliberate future—one that values savings, truth, and craft over speed and monetization. Includes a personal invitation to connect with others walking this path."

  "content": "In an inflationary system, the goal is often just to **keep up**.\n\nWith prices always rising, most of us are stuck in a race:\\\nEarn more to afford more.\\\nSpend before your money loses value.\\\nMonetize everything just to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nWork becomes reactive.\\\nYou hustle to outrun rising costs.\\\nYou take on projects you don’t believe in just to make next month’s bills.\\\nMoney decays. So you move faster, invest riskier, and burn out quicker.\n\nBut what happens when the curve flips?\n\nA **deflationary economy**—like the one Bitcoin makes possible—**rewards stillness, reflection, and intentionality**.\n\nTime favors the saver, not the spender.\\\nMoney gains purchasing power.\\\nYou’re no longer punished for patience.\n\nYou don’t have to convert your energy into cash before it loses value.\\\nYou don’t have to be *always on*.\\\nYou can actually afford to wait for the right work.\n\nAnd when you do work—it means more.\n\n💡 The “bullshit jobs” David Graeber wrote about start to disappear.\\\nThere’s no need to look busy just to justify your existence.\\\nThere’s no reward for parasitic middle layers.\\\nInstead, value flows to real **craft**, real **care**, and real **proof of work**—philosophically and literally.\n\nSo what does a job look like in that world?\n\n— A farmer building soil instead of chasing subsidies.\\\n— An engineer optimizing for simplicity instead of speed.\\\n— A craftsman making one perfect table instead of ten cheap ones.\\\n— A writer telling the truth without clickbait.\\\n— A builder who says no more than they say yes.\n\nYou choose work that **endures**—not because it pays instantly, but because it’s worth doing.\n\nThe deflationary future isn’t a fantasy.\\\nIt’s a **recalibration**.\n\nIt’s not about working less.\\\nIt’s about working **better**.\n\nThat’s what Bitcoin taught me.\\\nThat’s what I’m trying to live now.\n\n***\n\n🟠 **If you’re trying to align your work with these values, I’d love to connect.**\\\nZap this post, reply with your story, or follow along as I build—without permission, but with conviction.\\\n[\\[https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t\\](https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t)](https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t)\n",
