Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 24, 2025

**Friday morning, October 24.**
  
The house finally slept. The machines were off, the carrier empty, the medicine bottles lined neatly on the table like little sentinels. Whiskers lay curled in his usual spot by the window—same blanket, same sunlight—but the air around him felt newly consecrated, as if every breath were a borrowed gift.

We had survived Thursday. Barely.  

The night before had been the longest of my life. 

At the clinic I had memorized the numbers: thirty, forty, seventy-two. At home, the number that mattered was *twenty-four*—the count we’d prayed for. Each rise and fall of his chest was a confirmation that mercy still operated at ground level.

But the day after an emergency doesn’t feel like safety; it feels like aftermath.  
My body was still on alert even as the crisis receded. Every sound carried an undertone of panic—the click of his nails on the floor, the hum of the fridge, my own heartbeat in my ears. I wanted to celebrate but couldn’t yet believe it was over.

I sat at my desk around nine, charts open, markets flickering to life. Trading has always been half meditation, half measurement of mood. I told myself I would just watch, not act—but when the first signal lined up, muscle memory took over.  
Buy, wait, sell.  

Profit.  

A small win, but it felt larger than the numbers. After days of helplessness, the ability to make a decision that *worked* was its own medicine. Still, the tension between screens and silence was thick; I kept glancing back at the bed where he slept, as if the candles of one world might blow out the other.

The irony wasn’t lost on me: while he cycled through his medications every eight hours—diuretics to drain, heart meds to steady—I was dosing myself with tiny bursts of control. His treatment plan had precision; mine had improvisation. Both were forms of survival.

By noon, sunlight pooled across the hardwood and the room smelled faintly of the new food the vet recommended. Whiskers raised his head, blinked slowly, and sighed. That sigh undid me. I realized how much of my own breathing had been shallow for days. The body keeps vigil even after the mind forgets why. 

So I joined him on the floor. We didn’t move for a while. Just breathing, in sync again—the simplest communion.  

The human mind resists uneventful moments, but that’s exactly where healing hides. Crisis makes you feel alive in the worst way; recovery demands you stay alive in the quiet way. The adrenaline that carried us through Thursday had nowhere to go now but out. It leaked through tears I didn’t expect, through tremors in my hands when I refilled his water bowl. I wanted to be strong, yet what the moment required was softness.

Afternoon came and went without drama. He took his second dose, ate half a meal, then slept again. I closed my trades, logged the gains—small, steady—and realized the markets, too, had calmed. There was symmetry there: the world moves in cycles of expansion and rest, panic and reprieve. When one cycle ends, you don’t rush the next; you learn its tempo.

Evening light returned, gold across the floor, his fur glowing like warm brass. Kiyomi lit a candle. I thought about how many people in the SAGE waiting room never got to see this kind of light again. Gratitude and guilt often travel together; you can’t celebrate survival without glimpsing the shadow of loss.

Before bed I checked his breathing one more time: twenty-four. Perfect.
