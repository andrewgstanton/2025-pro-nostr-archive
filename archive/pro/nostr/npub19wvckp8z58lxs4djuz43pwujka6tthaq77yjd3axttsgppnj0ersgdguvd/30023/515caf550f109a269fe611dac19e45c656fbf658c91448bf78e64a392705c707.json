  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 22, 2025\n\nModern life feels strangely exhausting, even for people who work hard, manage their responsibilities, and act with integrity. Something is off. Something invisible but deeply structural. And it becomes clearest when you ask a deceptively simple question:\n\n**Who actually owns anything?**\n\nNot in the philosophical sense. Practically. Economically. Legally.\n\nBecause as soon as you tug on that thread, the entire architecture of the modern economic system begins to reveal itself — and what emerges is not a system built on production, innovation, or value creation, but a massive, interlocking *extraction engine*. The real “growth industry” of the world is rent seeking: capturing streams of income from people who have no choice but to pay.\n\nThis is the OS of the modern world.\n\nAnd it is built into everything.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Original Illusion: Ownership Without Sovereignty**\n\nYou can spend 30 years paying off a mortgage. You can maintain the property, improve it, raise children in it, pour yourself into it. And yet:\n\n- If you fail to pay property taxes, you lose it.  \n- If you fail to refinance when rates spike, you lose it.  \n- If you fall behind on insurance requirements, you can lose it.  \n- If zoning rules shift, you can lose the ability to use it as you want.  \n\nAnd consider the absurdity: **even if you have no mortgage**, you still pay perpetual rent to the state in the form of property taxes.\n\nThis isn’t ownership.  \nIt’s a lease in disguise.\n\nA lease that can never be paid off.\n\nEvery society that adopts property taxation eventually slips into this pattern: “ownership” becomes conditional, revocable, and dependent on continuous payment. You’re never fully sovereign over your land or home — you’re simply renting at a slower cadence.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Why the System Became Extractive**\n\nRent seeking didn’t emerge because people are greedy. Greed has always existed. What made it systemically possible — even inevitable — was the transition from sound money to elastic, credit-denominated money.\n\nWhen money can be created:\n\n- banks prefer long-term debt  \n- governments prefer continuous revenue streams  \n- institutions prefer predictable cash flows  \n- investors prefer assets that generate rents  \n\nAnd most importantly:\n\n**money creation rewards those who hold assets, not those who produce value.**\n\nOnce you introduce an elastic money supply, the system naturally evolves toward:\n\n- 30-year mortgages  \n- now 40-year mortgages  \n- and even 50-year mortgages  \n- lifetime student debt  \n- corporate buybacks funded by debt  \n- governments rolling over interest payments indefinitely  \n\nThis isn’t accidental.  \nThis is what elastic money *optimizes for*.\n\nIt prefers *streams of extraction* over *bursts of productivity*.  \n\nProductivity is risky.  \nDebt is safe.  \nRents are safe.  \nIncome streams are safe.\n\nWhen money is infinite, the incentive becomes clear:  \n**own the thing that people have to pay for again and again, forever.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Strange Fact: Every Layer Extracts From Below**\n\nLook at the stack:\n\n- The bank extracts interest.  \n- The state extracts property tax.  \n- The insurance provider extracts premiums.  \n- The bondholders extract yield.  \n- The corporate landlords extract rent.  \n- The HOA extracts dues.  \n\nEven utilities now function like rent-extractors: mandatory, continuous, unending.\n\nEvery layer of modern life is built around *mandatory recurring payments*.  \nThat is the rent-seeking OS.\n\nAnd the more leveraged the system becomes, the more it *requires* extraction simply to stay afloat.\n\nThis is why you see articles today celebrating the arrival of **50-year mortgages** as if they were progress. In reality, they represent nothing but the terminal stage of a system that cannot allow people to ever be debt-free.\n\nIf people became sovereign, the extraction engine would collapse.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Scarcity Isn’t Natural — It’s Manufactured**\n\nWe live on a planet overflowing with resources:\n\n- enough land  \n- enough food  \n- enough labor  \n- enough materials  \n- enough ingenuity  \n\nWhat we lack is not resources.  \nWe lack an honest monetary system.\n\nBecause an honest monetary system reveals abundance.  \nA dishonest monetary system manufactures scarcity.\n\nScarcity is what keeps rents high.  \nScarcity is what keeps debt long.  \nScarcity is what keeps wages suppressed.  \nScarcity is what keeps people compliant.\n\nIf you can’t escape, you can be extracted from.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Bitcoin Breaks the Extraction Logic**\n\nNow put Bitcoin into this picture — not as an ideology, but as a monetary fact.\n\nBitcoin does not allow:\n\n- arbitrary credit expansion  \n- infinite mortgages  \n- perpetual rolling of debt  \n- negative real rates  \n- stealth taxation via inflation  \n\nAnd because supply is fixed, debt must be:\n\n- smaller  \n- shorter  \n- lower-risk  \n- more conservative  \n- and *actually paid back*  \n\nThis means rent seeking no longer works as a universal business model.  \nThe extraction engine loses power.  \nThe yield-farming of human lives becomes impossible.\n\nOn a Bitcoin standard:\n\n- property taxes face political pressure  \n- ultra-long mortgages disappear  \n- lenders require skin in the game  \n- credit becomes reputation-based, not collateral-based  \n- communities, not megabanks, issue small loans  \n- ownership becomes literal, not nominal  \n\nBitcoin forces reality back into economics.\n\n---\n\n### **6. A World Where Extraction Fades and Ownership Returns**\n\nImagine 10–15 years from now:\n\n- Bitcoin is widely held.  \n- Salaries are partially paid in sats.  \n- Municipalities compete to reduce property taxes.  \n- Mortgages are 10–15 years, not 50.  \n- Down payments are higher because money cannot be conjured from nothing.  \n- Communities form lending circles with Bitcoin multisig.  \n- Houses are priced in a deflationary currency.  \n\nSuddenly, people can actually pay things off.  \nAnd once something is paid off, it stays paid off.\n\nFor the first time in modern memory, sovereignty becomes *achievable*.\n\nThis is why the existing system hates Bitcoin.  \nIt is not a competitor.  \nIt is an exit.\n\nThe world built on rent seeking cannot survive a world built on sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n### **7. The Extraction Engine Is Ending — Slowly, Then All at Once**\n\nThe global economy isn’t collapsing because people became irresponsible.  \nIt’s collapsing because the extraction OS can no longer run on reality.\n\n- Wages are stagnating.  \n- Debts are ballooning.  \n- Property taxes are rising.  \n- Mortgages are stretching into absurd lengths.  \n- Prices are decoupling from incomes.  \n\nThis is not mismanagement.  \nThis is entropy.\n\nWhen a system tries to extract more than reality can provide, it implodes.\n\nBitcoin isn’t just money — it’s a reset button.  \nA return to truth.  \nA return to sovereignty.  \nA return to real ownership.\n\nNot ownership conditional on taxes, inflation, or the whims of a central bank — but ownership rooted in time, work, and scarcity.\n\nReal wealth, not synthetic wealth.  \nReal value, not leveraged value.  \nReal homes, not perpetual rent streams.\n\nThe extraction engine is grinding down.  \nA sovereign future is beginning.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",

      "A clear, near-future reflection on how rent-seeking—not production—became the hidden operating system of modern economies. This article examines property taxes, 50-year mortgages, debt spirals, artificial scarcity, and the illusion of ownership, then contrasts it with the emerging Bitcoin paradigm where extraction breaks down and sovereignty returns to individuals."
