Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 25, 2025

Nature doesn’t fight the seasons. Only humans do.

Autumn never resists its own decline; it glorifies it. The trees blaze with color precisely as they die. There’s beauty in that surrender — a pattern God wrote into creation itself.

What if our civilizations are no different?

Every empire falls. Every institution decays. Every era ends. The question is not whether we can prevent it, but whether we can descend with grace — turning collapse into compost for renewal.

When we stop resisting the fall, we rediscover humility. We stop clinging to “greatness” and start cultivating goodness. We stop worshiping what we built and start remembering who we are.

The fall, after all, is not final. It’s preparatory.

The seed must crack before it grows. The leaf must drop before the soil renews. The ego must die before the soul can rise.

So perhaps the end of our age is not a tragedy, but a sacred turning — an invitation to rejoin the natural rhythm of death and resurrection that God wove into everything that lives.

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
