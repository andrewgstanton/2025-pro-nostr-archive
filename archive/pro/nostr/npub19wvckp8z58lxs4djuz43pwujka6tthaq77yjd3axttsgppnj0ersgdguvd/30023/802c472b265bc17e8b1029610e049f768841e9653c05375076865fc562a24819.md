At first glance, the modern creator economy feels like paradise. You can sign up for Canva, pick a template, and make something beautiful within minutes. You can upload your finished product to Gumroad, type in a price, and share a link. The software is sleek, the instructions simple, and the dopamine immediate. In the span of a single afternoon, you’ve gone from idea to market.

But underneath that convenience lies a hidden cost. Every “easy” platform is a trade. You hand over autonomy for speed, ownership for access, and control for convenience. What you build isn’t really *yours*—it’s a tenant inside someone else’s ecosystem.

The appeal of these systems is understandable. Most creators aren’t trying to reinvent the wheel—they just want to make things and share them. But the promise of “ease” has quietly reshaped the internet. Instead of publishing openly, we upload into silos. Instead of direct connection, we rely on middlemen who decide when and how our work gets seen. The interfaces are friendly; the infrastructure is anything but.

Consider a simple example: designing and selling an ebook. Canva gives you a template and lets you export a polished PDF. Gumroad lets you list the file and collect payments. Two platforms, two logins, two sets of terms and fees. Between them, they hold your design, your customers, and your revenue stream. You can’t reach buyers directly without their permission, and if either platform changes its policies—or vanishes—you lose the bridge between creator and audience overnight.

This fragmentation has become so normalized that most of us no longer notice it. We’re conditioned to believe that this is just “how the internet works.” But it wasn’t always so. The early web was rougher, yes—but it was open. You could host your own site, post your own files, and communicate without an intermediary. It required technical literacy, but it rewarded independence.

Today, that spirit has been replaced by an endless chain of subscriptions. Each layer promises to “handle the hard parts.” But the hard parts—hosting, payment, distribution—are precisely where sovereignty lives. When we outsource them, we outsource our future leverage.

Even social media follows this logic. We build audiences on borrowed servers, grow followings on rented algorithms, and then scramble to adjust when a new policy change cuts our reach. A creator’s livelihood now depends less on skill and more on staying in the good graces of opaque systems.

Yet the alternative is emerging quietly. Protocols like Nostr and Bitcoin restore something older and truer: direct connection. With them, creators don’t have to beg for export buttons—they own the key that signs their work. Identity becomes portable; value becomes peer-to-peer. It’s not “easy,” but it’s honest.

We’ve grown used to sleek dashboards that promise freedom through dependency. But real creative freedom begins where convenience ends. The friction of learning new systems—the discomfort of sovereignty—is the price of long-term stability. Better to struggle with open tools today than to build another masterpiece inside a cage.

Every “easy” button hides a lock. The key is remembering who it belongs to.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.

## Zaps Appreciated
If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.
