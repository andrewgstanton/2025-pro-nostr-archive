Everyone on Luna knew Dock Seven.

It wasn’t the largest docking ring.  
It wasn’t the newest.  
But it handled the most irregular traffic — retrofitted freighters, private consignments, and cargo no registry wanted to explain.

And Dock Seven answered to one man: **Calder Voss**.

Voss did not call himself an owner. He called himself a *steward*, which only made people angrier.

If you wanted reactor components moved without delays, you negotiated with Voss.  
If you needed off-ledger cargo transferred quietly, you negotiated with Voss.  
If your shipment stalled, it was because Voss said no.

He published his rules publicly.

No exclusive contracts.  
No political flags.  
No Earth enforcement writs honored.

This made him enemies everywhere.

Earth authorities accused him of laundering sovereignty.  
Lunar councils accused him of consolidating power.  
Builders accused him of becoming the very thing they fled.

Voss responded to none of it.

> “You don’t hate me,” he once said in a rare interview.  
> “You hate that scarcity has a face.”

Dock Seven became a proving ground for Lunar independence — not because it was pure, but because it was *real*.

On Luna, ideals mattered.  
But docks mattered more.
