Today I pause — not to celebrate, but to remember.\
Memorial Day is a reminder that freedom always comes at a cost. Not theoretical. Not digital. Real. Blood-bought. Passed down.

I didn’t earn the liberties I have. Someone else paid for them.\
The least I can do is *steward them well* — in how I live, build, and speak.

Tomorrow, I head to Bitcoin 2025.\
I go not just as a Bitcoiner, but as someone who believes Bitcoin, when rightly understood, calls us back to **truth**, **cost**, and **accountability**.\
Not magic internet money. Not another tech trend.\
But a reckoning.

So I walk into this week with both gratitude and resolve:

* Grateful for those who gave their lives.

* Grateful for the freedom to write, build, and think out loud.

* Resolved to use that freedom wisely — and to build systems that don't require bloodshed to sustain them.

Let’s build what lasts.\
Let’s remember what was paid.\
Let’s walk into Bitcoin 2025 with clear eyes and full hearts.
