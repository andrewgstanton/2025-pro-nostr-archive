Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 17, 2025

They did not call it a lockdown.

They called it **harmonization**.

By the time Elias Kade signed the manifest, the language had already shifted.  
No law was passed that day. No rockets were grounded. No alarms sounded.

The change arrived as a footnote.

Elias had been a launch systems engineer for twenty-seven years. He had signed off on hundreds of manifests—cargo, crew, research payloads, private ventures, public missions. The paperwork was boring by design. Boring meant stable. Boring meant safe.

This manifest was different.

The payload was civilian.  
The destination was orbital, then outbound.  
The funding was private.  
The compliance box was… new.

It wasn’t labeled *permission*.  
It was labeled *alignment*.

Elias scrolled back up and read the clause again.

“Outbound trajectories beyond Earth–Moon Lagrange Points must demonstrate alignment with the Unified Launch Governance Framework.”

Unified.

He opened the attached appendix and felt something cold settle in his chest.

The framework wasn’t technical.  
It wasn’t safety-related.  
It wasn’t even economic.

It was **moral**.

Launches, it argued, were no longer neutral acts.  
They were “civilizational commitments.”  
They required oversight.  
Consensus.  
Coordination.

No one had voted on this.

Elias looked out through the glass at the vehicle on the pad. White hull. Old-style architecture. Modular. Independent. Built by a team that still believed space was something you *went to*, not something you were *licensed to access*.

He knew the crew.  
He knew the builder.  
He knew this launch would never happen again.

The checkbox blinked on his screen.

Align.  
Or don’t.

He signed.

Not because he agreed.

But because he knew this would be the last time the signature meant *anything at all*.

Years later, historians would argue about when freedom ended.

Elias would know the answer.

It ended quietly.  
With a digital pen.  
And a man who understood what he was witnessing, and chose to remember it.

*This was the last free launch from Earth.*
