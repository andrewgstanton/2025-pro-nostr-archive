## Introduction: A City on Borrowed Land

San Francisco is one of the wealthiest, most globally visible cities in the world.  
But beneath the skyscrapers and tech campuses lies a history that most residents rarely think about: this city sits on the ancestral lands of the Ohlone people, specifically the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe.  

The Ohlone are still here. They remain a nation, even as they continue to fight for federal recognition. Yet the sovereignty of their people, like that of so many Native Nations, was stripped away long ago and never restored.  

At the same time, the residents of San Francisco today — condo owners, small businesses, families — are also increasingly trapped in a system of dependency. Property ownership is never absolute; stop paying taxes and the city takes it. Savings are eroded by inflation. Transactions are surveilled and controlled. Sovereignty has become a memory for some, and an illusion for others.  

The truth is simple: sovereignty matters. And in an age where the state grows ever more invasive, we need models that restore sovereignty at every level — Native and non-Native, individual and collective.

## The Vision: A Sovereignty Block

Imagine carving out a single block, or a district, in San Francisco that operates as a **Bitcoin Sovereignty Zone.**  

- **Property taxes suspended or returned locally.** Instead of wealth being siphoned to city hall, it stays in the community — pooled into a Bitcoin treasury, or invested back into shared infrastructure.  
- **True ownership.** Residents still own their condos, their shops, their land. Renters still rent. But ownership is protected from endless external extraction.  
- **Bitcoin economy.** Transactions within the zone run on Bitcoin and Lightning. Local businesses, services, and even governance are funded in a system outside of fiat inflation and surveillance.  
- **Sovereignty shield.** The Ohlone provide the sovereign framework, not as overlords, but as protectors. Their recognition as a sovereign tribe anchors the zone in legitimacy and history, while demonstrating a model of Native-led renewal that benefits all.  

This is not reparations. It is not dependency. It is sovereignty in practice.

## Why the Ohlone?

The Ohlone are uniquely positioned to lead such a project.  

- **Ancestral claim.** San Francisco is their land. Any sovereignty zone here must begin with that acknowledgment.  
- **Unrecognized, but resilient.** The Muwekma Ohlone have fought for decades for federal recognition. Creating a Bitcoin-based sovereignty zone would demonstrate sovereignty lived, not just sovereignty debated.  
- **Mutual benefit.** For the Ohlone, it would mean real visibility, economic strength, and a chance to lead. For residents, it would mean freedom from overreach and an experiment in true ownership.

## Learning from History

Kamehameha’s unification of Hawai‘i was a mixed blessing: it brought stability and law, but at the cost of centralization. When the throne fell, the entire kingdom fell.  

The same risk exists today in the modern state. Centralized sovereignty — even in the form of city hall or Sacramento — is fragile. Once captured, it becomes an instrument of control.  

A sovereignty zone anchored in Bitcoin avoids this trap. It provides unity without centralization, freedom without fragility. Every resident holds their keys. Every business transacts voluntarily. The system cannot be captured, because there is no throne to seize.

## Why San Francisco?

Because the contrast here is sharpest.  

- A city celebrated for innovation, yet increasingly trapped in bureaucracy and debt.  
- A city built on ancestral land, yet one where the living descendants of the Ohlone remain unrecognized.  
- A city of wealth, yet one where ownership is never absolute, and property is always at risk of seizure.  

By planting a Bitcoin Sovereignty Zone here — even just a block — San Francisco could demonstrate a different future. One where sovereignty is not nostalgia, but practice. Not performance, but proof.

## Conclusion: Sovereignty for All

The idea is not to create an enclave of privilege, nor to impose a new form of control. It is to demonstrate that sovereignty is possible here and now — for the Ohlone, for residents, for anyone willing to live outside dependency.  

Bitcoin makes it possible. The Ohlone make it legitimate. San Francisco makes it visible.  

Sovereignty is not something to be granted by empire. It is something to be lived. And the time to live it is now.  

**A single block could change everything.**
