They’re something worse: *they’re friction.* They’re the slow grind of a hundred little obstacles that pile on each other until you feel like you’re pushing through molasses. Today was one of those days.\n\nIt began with a small discouragement — my Nextdoor post going absolutely nowhere. Zero inquiries. Zero traction. Absolutely nothing. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. Because things like this always seem to come on the days when you’re already tired, when you don’t have the margin to be brushed off by an algorithm or ignored by neighbors who are more than happy to ask for favors but never seem to return the same energy.\n\nI don’t blame them. Everyone is busy, distracted, exhausted. But it still stung, in that small way that adds up over weeks of effort.\n\nAnd then there’s Rover — the middleman you’re supposed to be grateful for, even as they slice off a chunk of the very connection *you* nurture and maintain. Rover doesn’t feed Baxter. Rover doesn’t pick up after him, or stay late, or send videos to his owner. That’s me. But somehow the platform gets a cut because it built a walled garden around other human beings and convinced everyone to stay inside.\n\nI get why it works. People feel safer in walled gardens. But the longer I’ve lived inside them, the more suffocating they feel. Safe, yes. Comfortable, maybe. But stifling. Expensive. Limiting. And fragile in ways you only notice when something breaks.\n\nWhich brings me to YouTube.\n\nHelping Kiyomi get her site up — kikiskitchentable.com — took hours. I was proud of it, even though it drained the last of my energy. But YouTube’s system is its own maze of invisible rules, half-working features, and contradictory constraints. You add a link in the description? Not clickable. Want it to be clickable? Add it to the “Links” section. Oh, that’s not available on shorts. Want clickable links on shorts? Too bad — you don’t get that. But maybe you can add hashtags. Or maybe the pinned comment works. Or maybe not.\n\nIt feels like building on sand.  \nEvery platform is sand.\n\nBy mid-afternoon I caught myself thinking:  \n**Why am I fighting with these systems?**\n\nI built Continuum so I’d never have to do this again.  \nSo why am I still here?\n\n***\n\nBut the worst friction today wasn’t Nextdoor, Rover, or YouTube.\n\nIt was the quiet realization that the oldest Nostr events — my own posts from just six months ago — had effectively vanished from the relay landscape. Not the content, thankfully. Primal still had its backup copy. But the historical continuity? The relay provenance? The reconstructable event history?\n\nGone.\n\nThat’s when the friction turned into something darker. Not panic — I didn’t get emotional — but a kind of sinking heaviness. Because all the little frictions suddenly lined up and pointed to one truth:\n\n**Walled gardens are hard because they control you.  \nSovereign systems are hard because *you* control them.**\n\nWhen something breaks inside a walled garden, you can complain but you can’t fix it.  \nWhen something breaks in your own system, you have to fix it — even if you’re tired.\n\nAnd today I was so, so tired.\n\nI wanted to walk away from the screen. I wanted one day where everything just worked — where posts got responses, where platforms behaved, where my own code didn’t surprise me. But that’s not how sovereignty works. Freedom isn’t the absence of friction. It’s the presence of responsibility.\n\nAnd today, every system I touched reminded me:  \n**You chose this path.  \nYou chose to build outside the walls.  \nAnd this is the price.**\n\n***\n\nStill, there was one surprising shift today — and it didn’t come from writing code or fixing anything. It came from naming the frustration honestly.\n\nBecause once I admitted, even to myself, that everything today felt like friction, I could finally see something I’ve been ignoring: the friction is exactly what tells me I’m heading in the right direction. Walled gardens feel smooth not because they’re well-designed, but because they hide the truth.\n\nThey hide the edges.  \nThey hide the ownership.  \nThey hide the cost.  \nThey hide the risks.\n\nWhen YouTube doesn’t give you clickable links, you don’t get to fix it.  \nWhen Rover takes a fee, you don’t get to bypass it.  \nWhen Nextdoor buries your posts, you don’t get to argue.  \nWhen your oldest Nostr events disappear from relays, you don’t get to appeal to a central authority — because there isn’t one.\n\nDecentralization gives you autonomy but exposes you to reality.  \nCentralization keeps you protected but infantilizes you.\n\nToday I felt the full weight of that exposure.\n\n***\n\nBy evening I didn’t have a solution yet. I tried the rebroadcasting flow — it seemed logical enough — but it didn’t fix the missing events. Relays don’t magically reconstruct their pasts just because you shout the same words at them again.\n\nRebroadcasting, as it turns out, is not resurrection.\n\nBut even that failure carried a hint of direction. Because if rebroadcasting didn’t work, then the real solution would have to be something deeper. Something structural. Something that didn’t depend on relays or other people’s backups or the goodwill of any platform.\n\nI didn’t know it yet, but tomorrow would give me that solution.\n\nTonight I’m left with the friction, the exhaustion, and the faint but honest recognition that this is what sovereignty feels like in the beginning. Heavy. Slow. Resistant. Like pushing a ship into sea water before the buoyancy kicks in.\n\nBut ships do rise.  \nAnd tomorrow, mine will.\n\nTonight, though, it’s enough to admit that today was hard.  \nNot because anything catastrophic happened, but because *everything* required effort.\n\nSome days you write the code.  \nSome days the code writes you.\n\nToday, the friction wrote the story.  \nTomorrow, I begin rewriting it.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
