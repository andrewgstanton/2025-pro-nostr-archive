  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - July 13, 2025\n\nWith v1.4 of Continuum, I crossed a threshold I’ve been working toward for months:\n\n✅ Import my LinkedIn data  \n✅ Extract the profile, positions, and skills  \n✅ Automatically generate a `npub/nsec` identity  \n✅ Create and publish a valid `kind:0` event to Nostr  \n✅ Make the identity visible — and usable — in the Continuum dashboard\n\nThis isn’t just “federated identity.”  \nIt’s **data liberation**.\n\nI can now carry a representation of my professional profile **outside the LinkedIn silo**, sign and update it with my own key, and use it across any Nostr relay — or platform that respects open data.\n\nThe process:\n1. Export my LinkedIn ZIP\n2. Continuum parses the raw CSVs\n3. It generates a `profile.json` and a new `identity.json` (if one doesn't exist)\n4. It signs a `kind:0` event with that identity's `nsec`\n5. The event is published to multiple relays and visible on Primal, Snort, and more\n6. The identity appears in my Continuum dashboard — alongside my others\n\nEven better — the import is **idempotent**. If the profile already exists, nothing is overwritten.\n\nAnd yes — I still use LinkedIn. But now it's a **relay**, not a prison.\n\nThis is just the beginning. Up next:\n- LinkedIn article → `kind:30023`\n- A resume view in the dashboard\n- Possibly zaps and notes from this identity\n\n---\n\n🔐 Sovereign identity.  \n🛠 Self-hosted infrastructure.  \n📡 Cross-protocol publishing.\n\nContinuum is where it all connects.",

This article walks through how a LinkedIn export was transformed into a signed kind:0 event — published to relays and viewable inside the Continuum dashboard. It's a major milestone in bridging centralized platforms with decentralized identity."
