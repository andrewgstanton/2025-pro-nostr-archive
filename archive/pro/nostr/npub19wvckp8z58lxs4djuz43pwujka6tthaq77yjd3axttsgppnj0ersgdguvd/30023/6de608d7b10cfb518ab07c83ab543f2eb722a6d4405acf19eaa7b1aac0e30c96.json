  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 21, 2025\n\nLegacy is the truest measure of sovereignty. What we consume dies with us. What we build lives beyond us. To invest in legacy is to confess mortality but defy its finality.\n\nCathedral builders knew this. They laid stones for spires they would never see. They carved pillars for generations unborn. Parents know this. They labor for children they will never meet. Writers know this. They plant ideas that bloom centuries later. Every sovereign builder chooses legacy over consumption.\n\nFiat culture rejects legacy. It spends inheritances. It consumes the future. It devours resources for immediate gain. But sovereign builders choose differently. They plant trees whose shade they will never enjoy. They invest in truths that endure.\n\nBitcoin is legacy money. It cannot be debased. It cannot be consumed by inflation. It is incorruptible inheritance. To pass on Bitcoin is to pass on sovereignty, to bless generations beyond. It is the monetary cathedral of our age.\n\nFaith deepens this legacy. In Christ, death is defeated, and life is eternal. What we build in kindness, truth, and sovereignty is not wasted. It is anchored in eternity. Our cathedrals, our code, our incorruptible money—these are ways of giving death the finger, mocking its supposed victory.\n\nGenerations will come. We will go. But legacy remains. In Christ and in sovereignty, generations beyond us will live freer because we chose to build. That is the defiance of death, and that is the hope of eternity.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
