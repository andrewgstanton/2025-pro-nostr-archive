Stanton - Dec. 7, 2025\n\nLuna did not break away from Earth in anger.  \nIt simply walked a different road.\n\nThe Pelagia Compact—signed by representatives of thirteen enclaves, five guild coalitions, the Lakota Collective, and the Freeport Archivists—formalized a truth years in the making:\n\nLuna was a self-governing world.\n\n---\n\n## **I. Why It Happened**\nThe Compact emerged from several realities:\n\n- UEB could no longer enforce regulation  \n- Enclaves ran fully on lunar power  \n- Bitcoin settlement replaced Earth credits  \n- Circle Law resolved disputes better than terrestrial courts  \n- Freeport had become the cultural and intellectual capital of the diaspora  \n- Mars had launched Pilgrim-9  \n\nEarth’s relevance had evaporated.\n\nInstead of defiance, the Compact expressed **gratitude**:\n\n> “We honor the world that birthed us,  \n> but we must walk in the sovereignty that sustains us.”\n\n---\n\n## **II. What the Compact Actually Said**\nIt was only 289 words.\n\nKey clauses included:\n\n1. **Guild Autonomy**  \n   Guilds are foundational governance units.\n\n2. **Circle Law Supremacy**  \n   No external authority overrides Circle Law.\n\n3. **Enclave Self-Determination**  \n   Enclaves govern their own affairs.\n\n4. **Freeport Neutrality**  \n   Freeport remains independent and unowned.\n\n5. **Open Identity**  \n   No registry, census, or unified ID system.\n\n6. **Economic Independence**  \n   Bitcoin and local ledgers replace Earth settlement systems.\n\n7. **Non-Aggression**  \n   Luna will not attack Earth, nor submit to attack.\n\nThe Compact was humble, restrained, and wildly radical.\n\n---\n\n## **III. Earth’s Response**\nUEB declared the Compact:\n\n- unlawful  \n- illegitimate  \n- destabilizing  \n- “a misguided aspiration of loosely organized hobbyists”\n\nBut the truth was clear:\n\nEarth had **lost** the Moon years earlier.\n\nThe Compact merely formalized the loss.\n\n---\n\n## **IV. Legacy**\nThe Pelagia Compact became:\n\n- the first sovereign charter born off-world  \n- a blueprint for Martian governance  \n- the philosophical ancestor of the Sovereign Canon  \n- a foundational document of the Archivists’ stewardship  \n\nMartian historians would later write:\n\n> “Earth created colonies.  \n> Luna created a civilization.”  \n\n---",

      "summary",
      "The Pelagia Compact was not a rebellion, nor a revolution, nor a declaration of independence in the Earthly sense. It was a quiet agreement among guilds, enclaves, and Freeport elders—affirming that Luna had already outgrown Earth’s authority. The Compact merely put into words what had become true."
