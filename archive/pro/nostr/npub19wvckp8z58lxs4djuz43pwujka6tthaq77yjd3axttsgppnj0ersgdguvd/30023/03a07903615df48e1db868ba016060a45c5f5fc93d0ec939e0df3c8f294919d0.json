  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 15, 2025\n\nThe score did not arrive with alarms.\n\nIt arrived with dashboards.\n\nAt first, it was optional—a pilot program introduced to “streamline civic services” and “reduce friction in public systems.” Participation came with perks: faster approvals, priority access, smoother travel.\n\nPeople opted in gladly.\n\nEfficiency felt like freedom.\n\nThe score was calculated from ordinary behaviors. Nothing intrusive, the architects promised. Just *patterns*.\n\nAttendance records.  \nPayment history.  \nLanguage sentiment analysis.  \nNetwork proximity to flagged individuals.  \n\nEach datapoint harmless on its own. Together, they formed a portrait—one that claimed to be more objective than character, more reliable than reputation.\n\nThe score replaced judgment with arithmetic.\n\nIt was expressed as a simple number between 0 and 100, color-coded for ease of interpretation.\n\nGreen meant trusted.  \nYellow meant watchful.  \nRed meant restricted.\n\nPeople learned quickly where they stood.\n\nEmployers began including minimum scores in job postings. Schools quietly adjusted admissions thresholds. Travel systems routed low-score individuals into “manual review,” a euphemism for indefinite delay.\n\nThe system insisted it was not punitive.\n\nIt merely reflected reality.\n\nThat was the most dangerous lie.\n\nThe score did not measure truthfulness, courage, or integrity.  \nIt measured *predictability*.\n\nThose who complied reliably scored higher.  \nThose who questioned frequently scored lower.\n\nThe math was elegant.\n\nEach deviation incurred a small penalty. Nothing dramatic. No single infraction mattered much. But penalties compounded, and recovery required sustained behavioral correction.\n\nPeople adapted.\n\nThey learned which phrases triggered sentiment downgrades.  \nWhich associations were statistically “risky.”  \nWhich causes were safe to support publicly—and which were better kept offline, or not thought about at all.\n\nConscience became inefficient.\n\nThe score rewarded alignment, not virtue.\n\nParents coached children on score hygiene the way earlier generations taught table manners.\n\n“Don’t comment on that.”  \n“Don’t repost that article.”  \n“Remember, everything counts.”\n\nTeachers framed it as preparation.\n\n“You’re not being judged,” they said. “You’re being *measured*.”\n\nMeasurement felt neutral. Scientific. Fair.\n\nBut neutrality disappears when numbers become destiny.\n\nA young woman with a score of 82 could rent an apartment without issue.  \nA man with a 67 needed a co-signer.  \nA family with a combined household score below 70 received “supportive interventions.”\n\nInterventions felt helpful—until they weren’t optional.\n\nThe system claimed it did not enforce morality.\n\nIt merely optimized outcomes.\n\nBut when outcomes determined access to life itself, optimization *was* morality.\n\nPeople began to outsource ethical decisions to the score.\n\n“Is this allowed?” became “Is this worth the hit?”\n\nCourage was reframed as recklessness.  \nDissent as poor risk management.\n\nThe score taught a generation to calculate obedience.\n\nAnd because it was numeric, it felt incontestable.\n\nYou could argue with a person.  \nYou could not argue with an algorithm.\n\nAppeals were possible, of course—but they were handled by systems that referenced the same metrics that produced the score in the first place.\n\nCircular logic disguised as due process.\n\nThose who fell too low learned to disappear.\n\nThey avoided public spaces.  \nThey minimized digital presence.  \nThey spoke in trusted rooms, using old devices when they could find them.\n\nThey were not criminals.\n\nThey were statistically inconvenient.\n\nThe score had one final, devastating effect: it **redefined guilt**.\n\nYou were no longer guilty because you did something wrong.  \nYou were guilty because you *trended incorrectly*.\n\nDeviation itself became the crime.\n\nAnd yet, beneath the smooth curves and reassuring dashboards, something remained unresolved.\n\nThe score could measure obedience.\n\nBut it could not measure *truth*.\n\nIt could not account for the quiet refusal of an engineer who declined to install a backdoor.  \nIt could not quantify the resolve of a parent who chose integrity over employment.  \nIt could not see the value of a private key held offline, beyond the reach of metrics.\n\nThe system sensed this blind spot.\n\nThat was why it feared those who opted out entirely.\n\nBecause a number can only rule a world that agrees to be counted.\n\nAnd somewhere, quietly, people were learning how to stop counting.",
