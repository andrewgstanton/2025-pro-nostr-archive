  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 31, 2025\n\nTom Clancy built empires of realism without ever stepping inside a government vault. He studied open information, connected dots, and trusted reason over rumor. What he proved — and what Bitcoin and Nostr prove again today — is that **truth doesn’t need permission**.\n\nThe essence of intelligence isn’t access; it’s inference.  \nWhen you understand incentives, systems, and human nature, secrets become predictable. Bureaucracies leak their intentions through structure; empires reveal their weakness in what they try to hide. The wise don’t chase leaks — they model behavior.\n\nThat’s the “Clancy Method”: disciplined curiosity anchored in logic, not ideology. It’s the same posture that keeps sovereign builders free — to see clearly, act decisively, and refuse the seduction of hidden knowledge.\n\nVerification always outperforms classification.  \nThe map belongs to those who can read it.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
