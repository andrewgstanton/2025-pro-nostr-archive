  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - May 18, 2025\\\n\\\nWeb3 talked a lot about freedom.\\\nBut it didn’t ask much of me.\n\nParticipation meant showing up, clicking, co-signing, reacting.\\\nA few emoji could pass a vote. A few posts could signal alignment.\\\nBut there was no real cost.\\\nNo friction.\\\nNo weight.\n\nIt felt easy — and eventually, it felt empty.\n\n***\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, never asked for my attention.\\\nIt demanded my effort.\n\nProof of Work isn’t just what *secures* Bitcoin.\\\nIt’s what shapes the people who actually engage with it.\n\nYou can’t fake time.\\\nYou can’t fake energy.\\\nYou can’t fake commitment.\n\nIf you want to mine a block, you need to burn electricity.\\\nIf you want to hold your keys, you need to learn what that means.\\\nIf you want to build with Bitcoin, you’re staking *skin*, not vibes.\n\n***\n\nEventually I realized: this isn’t just a consensus algorithm.\\\nIt’s a *way of seeing the world*.\n\nProof of Work is an ethic.\\\nIt values restraint.\\\nIt rewards effort.\\\nIt penalizes shortcuts.\n\nIt’s the opposite of what most of the internet has become.\n\n***\n\nWeb3 tried to engineer consensus through incentive design — but consensus without cost is hollow.\n\nIn Bitcoin, there is no shortcut to agreement.\\\nYou either do the work, or you don’t get a say.\\\nYou can’t tweet your way into a block. You can’t fork your way into consensus.\\\nYou *earn* your way — through time, electricity, and conviction.\n\n***\n\nThe deeper I leaned into Bitcoin, the more it reshaped me:\n\n* I stopped trying to “move fast” and started focusing on *lasting things*.\n\n* I began to care more about how work was *verified*, not just how it looked.\n\n* I started pruning systems — and relationships — that couldn’t carry weight.\n\nEven in how I think about faith, work, rest, and community — I’ve started asking:\n\n\\> Is this real?\\\n\\> Does this cost anything?\\\n\\> Is this proof of *something*?\n\n***\n\nFiat culture taught me to act like time was cheap.\\\nPoW culture reminded me: **time is everything**.\n\nFiat let me pretend I could get something for nothing.\\\nPoW told me the truth — *you can’t.*\n\n***\n\nI no longer want to participate in systems that reward shortcuts.\\\nI want to build slowly, honestly, and with weight.\n\nProof of Work isn’t just what runs Bitcoin.\\\nIt’s what reforms me.\n\n***\n\n⚡ If this resonates, zap me some sats — or pass it forward.\\\n🤖 Drafted with the help of ChatGPT, who also prefers work over noise.\n",
