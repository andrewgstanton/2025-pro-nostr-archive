Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 9, 2025

I have always found myself living between two worlds. On one side is the world of Christian ministry—pastors, leaders, communities of faith who speak often of the Kingdom of God, prayer, and service. On the other is the sovereign world—Bitcoiners, builders, technologists, and thinkers who speak of freedom, censorship-resistance, and self-sovereignty.

At first glance, these two worlds seem far apart. One deals in spiritual truths, the other in technical protocols. One gathers in churches, the other in meetups and conferences. Yet for me, the overlap has become impossible to ignore. Both worlds, at their best, point toward freedom.

The ministry world has given me a foundation of conviction. It has taught me to care about people, to look beyond material success, and to hold fast to eternal truths. But it has also been frustrating at times—caught in old structures, hesitant to embrace change, often compromised by the same systems of debt and fiat that hold society captive. I have watched churches fund expansion through loans, ministries bound by government rules because of tax exemptions, and leaders forced into silence for fear of losing funding.

The sovereign world, by contrast, feels like a frontier. Builders, writers, and thinkers are carving new paths where individuals can own their identity, their wealth, and their voice. It is raw, unpolished, often messy, but also filled with conviction and courage. Here, freedom is not just preached—it is coded. People experiment with Lightning payments, Nostr relays, and decentralized storage. Mistakes happen, yes, but every step forward feels like building something lasting.

Living between these two worlds is not easy. Ministry friends sometimes don’t understand my passion for Bitcoin or self-sovereignty. Sovereign friends sometimes dismiss faith as irrelevant or naive. I find myself translating constantly, building bridges where I can. Because I believe these two worlds actually need each other.

Without sovereignty, ministry risks becoming captive to the very powers it critiques. How can a church preach freedom in Christ while chained to debt, or preach truth while dependent on institutions that can censor it? Without ministry, sovereignty risks becoming hollow—freedom without purpose, autonomy without love. A world where everyone owns their keys but no one knows what they are for is no more inspiring than the old one we left behind.

There are moments when I feel the tension strongly. I have stood in Bible studies where the dangers of money were discussed, while knowing that Bitcoin could protect those very communities from inflation. I have sat in Bitcoin circles where freedom was praised but faith dismissed, while knowing that true freedom without love easily curdles into selfishness. In both cases, I feel called to speak—not to argue, but to bridge.

Perhaps my calling lies not fully in one world or the other, but in the space between. To speak to ministry leaders about sovereignty as stewardship. To speak to sovereign builders about faith as foundation. To weave a fabric that is stronger than either world could be alone.

The two worlds may look different, but in truth they are both searching for the same thing: a way to live free, with integrity, and with hope. The overlap is the future. And it is where I choose to live.

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.
