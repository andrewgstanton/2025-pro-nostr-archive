  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 1, 2025\n\n---\n\nTo be human  \nis to bear the imprint of the Creator Himself.\n\nNot physically.  \nNot biologically.  \nBut ontologically.\n\nThe image is not about appearance.  \nIt is about *being*.\n\nTo bear the image is to possess:\n\n- the capacity to know truth  \n- the authority to choose  \n- the freedom to act  \n- the responsibility to judge  \n- the power to create  \n- the dignity to love  \n- the ability to shape the world  \n- the call to steward creation  \n\nSovereignty is not an ideology.  \nIt is identity.\n\nThe dignity God possesses in infinite measure  \nHe shares with humanity  \nin finite measure.\n\nThis is why tyranny is evil:  \nit attempts to erase the image.\n\nWhy lies are corrosive:  \nthey distort the mind made to discern truth.\n\nWhy exploitation is dehumanizing:  \nit treats sovereign beings as resources.\n\nIn the Chronicles universe,  \nsovereignty is not a political preference  \nbut a **cosmic inheritance**.\n\nEvery human carries a flame  \nolder than the stars —  \na spark of the Creator’s own nature.\n\nAnd that flame  \nwas never meant to remain on one world.",
