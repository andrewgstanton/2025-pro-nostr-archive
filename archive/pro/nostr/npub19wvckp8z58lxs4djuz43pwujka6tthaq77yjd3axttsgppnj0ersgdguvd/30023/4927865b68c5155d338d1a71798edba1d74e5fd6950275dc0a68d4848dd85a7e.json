  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 21, 2025\n\nThe Sabbath command taught humanity to rest one day in seven. But in Christ, Sabbath is not only observed—it is fulfilled. His rest in the tomb on the seventh day completed creation’s pattern. His resurrection on the first day began new creation.\n\nSunday thus becomes both beginning and fulfillment. It is the eighth day, the dawn of eternity. In this light, death is reframed. It is not the end of life but the threshold of eternal life. Sabbath rest leads to resurrection life.\n\nFiat cultures deny this. They treat death as failure and resurrection as myth. They cling to Saturday but never rise to Sunday. They idolize cycles of work and rest without seeing the eternal horizon. But resurrection changes the story. It makes mortality a passage, not a prison.\n\nSovereignty means living in that resurrection light. It means refusing to measure worth by productivity or longevity. It means building not for consumption but for legacy. It means resting in Christ’s work and rising in Christ’s life.\n\nBitcoin echoes Sunday discipline. It demands patience through cycles, hope through volatility, and trust in truths that endure. Like resurrection, it is incorruptible, unbound by fiat decay. To hold Bitcoin is to confess hope in a future beyond present consumption.\n\nSabbath is complete. Life begins. Death is defeated. Hope is eternal. That is the story of Sunday, and it is the story of sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
