From the beginning, creation pointed toward rest. God rested on the seventh day, not because He was weary, but because the work was finished. Sabbath was humanity’s invitation to participate in that rest. Yet in a fallen world, rest became burden. Work multiplied, toil expanded, and humanity filled its days with striving. Sabbath became law, and law revealed our restlessness.

In Christ, the law of Sabbath is fulfilled. His cry from the cross—“It is finished”—echoes the Creator’s rest in Genesis. The ultimate work of salvation is complete. Sabbath rest is no longer one day a week but a reality that shapes all days. It is not escape from mortality but victory over it.

Fiat cultures despise rest. They idolize productivity, speed, and endless consumption. They turn even leisure into industry, selling distraction instead of peace. At death, fiat medicine often treats the human body as a machine to be kept running at all costs, denying the dignity of rest. Sovereignty resists by embracing true Sabbath rest: not endless striving, but trust in Christ’s completed work.

For mortals, Sabbath rest is preparation for death. It teaches us to stop, to release, to trust. It whispers that death is not the end, but the doorway to eternal rest. In this light, hospice is not failure but faithfulness: a recognition that life ends, but not without hope.

Bitcoin embodies Sabbath discipline. It demands patience and rewards stillness. It teaches us to hold, to resist the urge to spend or inflate away. Just as Sabbath rest resists fiat busyness, Bitcoin resists fiat urgency. Both prepare us to face death without fear.

The true Sabbath is resurrection. Sunday dawns as the eighth day, the new creation. In Christ, the work is complete, death is defeated, and eternal life begins. Resting in that eternal work, we are free to live and die in hope.
