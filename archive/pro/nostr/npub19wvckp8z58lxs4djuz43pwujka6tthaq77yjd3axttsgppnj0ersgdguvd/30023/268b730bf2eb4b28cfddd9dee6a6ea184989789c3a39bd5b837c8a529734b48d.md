People throw the word “sovereign” around a lot. Here are three quick checks I use:

- **Custody**: Do I hold the keys? If not, I don’t control it.
- **Identity**: Is my presence tied to my npub (or something I own), or is it rented from a platform?
- **Exit**: If I leave, can I take my data, audience, and value with me?

If the answer is “no” to any of these, it’s not sovereignty — it’s just decentralization dressed up as freedom.
