  "content": "Andrew G Stnaton Aug. 31, 2025\n\nFive centuries after the first settlers set foot on Mars, the Cathedral still stands. It did not rise in a single decade or under a single flag. It began humbly, almost invisibly, in the 2070s — when the first generation born on Martian soil had come of age.\n\n## The First Councils\n\nThe settlement of New Lakota had been established for fifty years. Domes and mines dotted the horizon, water and oxygen were secure, and families had begun to think not only of survival, but of permanence.\n\nThe Council of New Lakota and other pioneer groups gathered to debate what Mars needed most. More habitats? More mines? Or something less urgent but more enduring?\n\nThey chose to build a meeting hall — a place of remembrance and gathering. Not sectarian, not only political, but something that could outlast domes, laws, and lifetimes. They called it a Cathedral.\n\nThe settlers pooled their resources — small donations, often just a satoshi or two — through Lightning channels. Every contribution was etched into the chain, transparent, incorruptible. For them, it was not about grandeur, but about covenant. A declaration that humanity on Mars would not only live, but endure.\n\n## A Hall That Became a Monument\n\nThe first stones were Martian basalt, cut and stacked with primitive tools. Names of donors were scratched into the walls. Children born under the red sky pressed their handprints into wet mortar.\n\nAs new waves of settlers arrived in the 22nd and 23rd centuries — Pacific diaspora, African pioneers, engineers from across Earth — each group added their mark. Mosaics, carvings, stained glass shipped across interplanetary freighters. The Cathedral grew layer by layer, century by century, until its nave and arches dwarfed the original hall.\n\nIt was never finished, because it was never meant to be. It was a living record of humanity’s pilgrimage.\n\n## A Place of Pilgrimage\n\nBy the 2400s, when physicists unlocked the secret of quantum entanglement and humanity stepped through bridges to the stars, the Cathedral was already three centuries old. Pilgrims returned there to celebrate the first galactic block — when Bitcoin’s chain was confirmed simultaneously on Mars and Alpha Centauri.\n\nThe Cathedral became the natural place to inscribe these milestones. Its walls bore not only the names of the first settlers, but the moment humanity became one again across the stars.\n\n## Bitcoin’s Quiet Role\n\nThe Cathedral was never owned by kings or corporations. Its survival came from something quieter: an incorruptible treasury. Each satoshi given by a farmer on Mars, a miner in the Belt, or a technician on Europa was preserved and used to maintain the structure.\n\nAcross centuries of shifting politics and forgotten empires, the ledger endured. Where Earth’s governments inflated their currencies into dust, the Cathedral’s satoshi endowment grew ever more meaningful. A gift once thought trivial — a single sat in 2075 — became priceless by the 2600s.\n\nThat deflationary arc reshaped culture. To give was not to waste. To hold was not to hoard. It was stewardship.\n\n## Shadows and Promises\n\nAnd yet, for all its endurance, the Cathedral was never the consummation. Its stones weathered Martian dust. Its vaults creaked under centuries of additions. Even as humanity now spanned the stars, the Cathedral reminded pilgrims that permanence built by mortal hands is always partial.\n\nRevelation spoke of a city where the nations would bring their glory, a city where there was no decay, no night, no curse. The Cathedral was not that city. It was a shadow of it, a signpost pointing forward.\n\n## Epilogue\n\nFive hundred years after its foundation, the Cathedral remains the heart of Mars. Pilgrims still step into its halls before departing for the stars. They trace the first stones laid by the New Lakota settlers in the 2070s. They whisper the names of those who believed Mars was more than a mine, more than a dome, more than survival.\n\nThe Cathedral stands as testimony: humanity is not only scattered, not only political, not only temporary. We are stewards, pilgrims, builders of permanence. And even in stone and chain, our hands whisper of a greater permanence yet to come.",
