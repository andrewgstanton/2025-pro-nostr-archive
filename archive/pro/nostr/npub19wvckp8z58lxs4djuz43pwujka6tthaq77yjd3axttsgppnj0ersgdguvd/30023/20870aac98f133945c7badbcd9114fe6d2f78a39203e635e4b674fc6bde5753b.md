Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 22, 2025

Walk into any grocery store today, and you’ll see it: prices climbing, packaging shrinking, and yet, somehow, everyone pretending it’s normal. The trick of fiat inflation isn’t only economic—it’s psychological. When money loses meaning, so does value itself.

Inflation creeps into language, art, attention. We scroll faster, spend quicker, and chase novelty instead of quality. Everything feels more expensive because everything is more *empty*. 

We are not paying more for food or rent—we’re paying for the illusion that the system still works.

When dollars multiply, time devalues. When time devalues, culture rots. The result is an economy of exhaustion—people working harder, earning less, and buying worse. Fiat doesn’t just erode savings; it erodes taste, judgment, and dignity. 

Bitcoiners feel this most acutely because they’ve opted out of the lie. When you anchor your life to something finite, the infinite noise of fiat becomes unbearable. You start noticing the inflation of *everything*—from celebrity activism to corporate virtue signals. It’s all debt, all deficit, all drag.

Sound money isn’t just a hedge against inflation—it’s a defense against cultural entropy.
