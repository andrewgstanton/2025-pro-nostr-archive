Most people confuse “participation” with “ownership.” They think because they have a profile and can post, they’re in control. But the real test of sovereignty is simpler: can you exit without losing yourself?

Try this thought experiment:

- If you delete your Twitter account today, what comes with you? Not your followers. Not your history. Not your name. It’s all tied to their database.
- If you leave LinkedIn, does your resume come with you? No — it vanishes into their servers.
- If YouTube bans you, what happens to your channel, your videos, your audience? It’s gone.

Exit is where the truth is revealed. Sovereignty without exit is a costume.

With Nostr, the equation flips. Your npub is portable. Your content is events you sign. Your followers aren’t “subscribers” inside one company — they’re people who’ve chosen to follow your key. You can leave any relay tomorrow, join another, or host your own, and your identity persists.

That’s why exit is the non-negotiable mark of sovereignty. If you can’t take your identity, value, and voice with you, you never owned them in the first place.
