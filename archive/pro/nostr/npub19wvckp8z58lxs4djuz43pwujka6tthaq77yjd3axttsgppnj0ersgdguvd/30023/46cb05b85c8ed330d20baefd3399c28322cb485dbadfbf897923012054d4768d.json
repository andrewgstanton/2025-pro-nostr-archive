The Uncomfortable Truth: The New Testament Never Commands Christians to Tithe**\nMany Christians assume that “tithing” (giving 10% of income) is a universal biblical requirement.\n\nIt isn’t.\n\nNot once—**not a single time**—does the New Testament command Christians to give 10%.\n\nJesus never taught it.  \nPaul never taught it.  \nPeter and John never taught it.  \nThe early church never practiced it.\n\nInstead, the New Testament emphasizes:\n\n- generosity  \n- cheerful giving  \n- sacrificial love  \n- Spirit-led stewardship  \n- care for the poor  \n- support for ministry  \n\nBut never a fixed percentage.\n\n---\n\n## **II. What Tithing Actually Was in the Old Testament**\nModern sermons often distort what the tithe truly was. Biblically, tithing was nothing like the modern “10% of your paycheck” model.\n\n### **1. The tithe was agricultural, not monetary**\nThe tithe was **produce from the land of Israel**—not wages, salaries, profits, or general wealth.\n\n> “The tithe of the *land*, whether of seed or fruit, is the Lord’s.”  \n> — *Leviticus 27:30*\n\nA carpenter did not tithe chairs.  \nA fisherman did not tithe fish.  \nA merchant did not tithe profits.\n\nOnly farmers and herdsmen tithed, and only from God’s promised land.\n\n### **2. Israel had multiple tithes**\nIsrael’s tithes included:\n\n- the **Levitical tithe** (for priests),  \n- the **Festival tithe** (for national feasts),  \n- the **Poor tithe** (every third year).  \n\nAltogether, this functioned as a **national tax system** under Mosaic law.\n\n### **3. Tithing ended with the Old Covenant**\nTithing belonged to:\n\n- the Temple,  \n- the Levitical priesthood,  \n- the promised land of Israel.\n\nAll fulfilled or dissolved in Christ.\n\n---\n\n## **III. Why the New Testament Never Commands Christians to Tithe**\nBecause the New Covenant replaces law-based giving with **free, Spirit-formed generosity.**\n\nPaul makes this unmistakably clear:\n\n> “Each one must give as he has decided in his heart,  \n> not reluctantly or under compulsion,  \n> for God loves a cheerful giver.”  \n> — *2 Corinthians 9:7*\n\nUnder the New Covenant:\n\n- Giving is voluntary.  \n- Giving is joyful.  \n- Giving is relational.  \n- Giving is Spirit-led.  \n- Giving is proportional to ability.  \n- Giving is an act of worship, not obligation.\n\nThere is no law, no percentage, no threat of curse.\n\n---\n\n## **IV. The Real New Testament Standard: Everything Belongs to God**\nIronically, modern tithing **lowers** the biblical standard.\n\n“Give God 10%; keep the other 90%.”\n\nBut Jesus teaches that:\n\n> **God owns 100% of everything we have.**\n\nThe New Testament vision is:\n\n- full stewardship,  \n- open-handed generosity,  \n- sacrificial giving,  \n- love for the poor,  \n- support for the gospel,  \n- and Spirit-guided offerings.\n\nChristian giving is not a tax.  \nIt is worship.\n\n---\n\n## **V. But Should Christians Be Generous? Yes—More Than Ever**\nRejecting tithing does not reject generosity.\n\nChristians are called to:\n\n- give sacrificially,  \n- support the needy,  \n- strengthen the church,  \n- care for missionaries,  \n- and live open-handedly.\n\nThe New Covenant raises the bar.  \nBut it removes compulsion.\n\n---\n\n## **VI. The Problem With Modern Tithing Theology**\nTithing sermons often produce:\n\n- guilt  \n- superstition  \n- prosperity formulas (“give to get”)  \n- fear (“you’ll be cursed if you don’t”)  \n- manipulation  \n- or transactional spirituality  \n\nBut the New Covenant produces:\n\n- joy  \n- freedom  \n- discernment  \n- humility  \n- generosity  \n- overflowing love  \n\nThe issue is not “giving less.”  \nIt is **giving from the right covenant**.\n\n---\n\n## **VII. What About Abraham and Melchizedek?**\nThis is the most common argument used to justify tithing today.\n\n> “Abraham tithed to Melchizedek—so Christians should tithe!”\n\nBut this misunderstands the passage completely.\n\n### **1. Abraham tithed only once**\nThis was not regular giving.  \nIt occurred **one time** in his entire recorded life.\n\n### **2. Abraham tithed from war spoils, not his own wealth**\nGenesis 14 is clear: the tithe came from **plunder taken in battle**, not personal income.\n\nAbraham never tithed:\n\n- wages  \n- flocks  \n- crops  \n- profits  \n- inheritance  \n- annual produce  \n\nJust war plunder.\n\n### **3. Abraham gave 10% and kept 0%**\nHe gave:\n\n- 10% to Melchizedek,  \n- **and the remaining 90% to the king of Sodom.**\n\nIf this were a model for Christians, then:\n\n> “Give 10% to your pastor and 90% to your enemies.”\n\nNo one teaches that because the story is **not a command**.  \nNot a pattern.  \nNot a rule.\n\n### **4. Hebrews never uses this as a giving command**\nThe New Testament uses Melchizedek to show **Christ’s superior priesthood**, not to teach tithing.\n\nThere is no command to imitate Abraham’s gesture.\n\n---\n\n## **VIII. What About Malachi 3? (“Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse…”)**\nThis is the second most common prooftext for tithing sermons.  \nBut it is consistently misinterpreted.\n\n### **1. Malachi was written to Israel under Mosaic law**\nNot to Christians.  \nNot to the Church.  \nNot under grace.\n\nIt addressed:\n\n- agricultural tithes,  \n- Temple service,  \n- Levitical priests,  \n- covenant curses,  \n- and blessings tied to the land.\n\nYou cannot apply Malachi without re-imposing the entire Mosaic system.\n\n### **2. The “storehouse” was a literal food warehouse**\nThe storehouse was where Israel stored:\n\n- grain  \n- wine  \n- oil  \n- produce  \n\nNot money.  \nNot salaries.  \nNot modern offerings.\n\n### **3. The blessings and curses were agricultural**\n“I will pour out a blessing” referred to **rain and harvest**.  \n“Devourer” referred to **locusts**.\n\nNot finances.  \nNot bank accounts.\n\n### **4. The New Testament never repeats Malachi’s command**\nJesus and Paul both taught giving—  \nbut never repeated Malachi’s requirement.\n\nMalachi is Old Covenant.  \nChristians are not under it.\n\n---\n\n## **IX. Why These Two Passages Cannot Establish Christian Tithing**\nNeither Genesis 14 nor Malachi 3 provides:\n\n- a command to tithe today  \n- a percentage requirement  \n- a New Covenant obligation  \n- support for pastoral salaries  \n- a church budget model  \n- a prosperity formula  \n- a doctrine of spiritual cursing  \n\nUsing these texts to impose tithing is **mixing covenants** and misrepresenting Scripture.\n\n---\n\n## **X. The New Covenant Way: Generosity, Not Legalism**\nLet’s state it plainly:\n\n> **God is not asking for a percentage.  \nHe is asking for your heart.**\n\nIf the Spirit leads someone to give 10%, wonderful.  \nIf He leads them to give more, even better.  \nIf a struggling believer gives less for a time, that is grace—not sin.\n\nChristian giving is:\n\n- voluntary  \n- cheerful  \n- sacrificial  \n- Spirit-led  \n- proportionate  \n- relational  \n- and rooted in love  \n\n**The tithe belonged to Israel.  \nGenerosity belongs to the Church.**\n\n---",

      "A clear, biblical examination of tithing in the Old and New Testaments. The tithe was an Old Covenant agricultural system tied to ancient Israel—not a binding command for Christians. The New Covenant calls us to something greater: Spirit-led generosity grounded in the truth that God owns everything, not just a percentage."
