### **Introduction: Why Money Matters to Faith**

Most of us don’t think about *money* theologically. But Scripture speaks of it often — not just as a tool, but as a test.

Jesus said, *“Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”* (Matthew 6:21). The love of money, not money itself, is called the root of all kinds of evil. And dishonest scales? “An abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 11:1).

So what happens when the entire system of money becomes dishonest — when it’s based not on work or value, but manipulation and control?

That’s the world Bitcoin was born into. And it offers a radically different way — one that, surprisingly, echoes deep truths of the Christian faith — and especially what many call the **Victorious Gospel**: the belief that Christ’s redemption is not partial, but total. Not only personal, but cosmic.

***

## **1. What Is Bitcoin, and Why Was It Created?**

**Bitcoin** is a new kind of money that isn't controlled by any government or company. You can send it anywhere in the world, and no one can block or censor your transaction. It’s digital, but unlike credit cards or PayPal, it’s not just “numbers in a bank.” It is **scarce, secure, and independent.**

The key idea is this: Bitcoin is **money backed by work** — not by trust in a government, but by real energy and effort.

Why is that important? Because the current system of money — what we call **fiat** — works very differently.

***

## **2. What Is Fiat, and Why Is It Broken?**

“**Fiat**” simply means “by decree.” It’s the money we all use today — dollars, euros, yen — created by government decree. It used to be backed by gold. Not anymore.

Today, new fiat money is created whenever a central bank wants. It can be “printed” digitally without cost. This leads to **inflation** — meaning your savings buy less over time.

It’s like a form of slow theft. You worked hard for your dollars, but someone else can create more with a click. That’s not just bad economics — it violates biblical principles of fairness, honesty, and stewardship.

Bitcoin fixes this by making money that **cannot be faked or inflated**, because it’s based on **Proof of Work** — and is capped at a fixed amount.

***

## **3. What Is Proof of Work — and Why It Matters**

Imagine you want to add a page to a history book — but to make it trustworthy, you must **solve a complex puzzle** that proves you did real work. Once solved, everyone else can see the solution and verify it was done properly.

That’s **Proof of Work**, the system Bitcoin uses to record transactions. Each time people send Bitcoin, that transaction gets added to a public ledger (called the **blockchain**). But it can only be added if someone does the work to secure it — using energy, effort, and computer power.

This work:

* **Costs something** (just like real-world labor),

* **Prevents cheating** (you can’t just rewrite history),

* And **rewards the worker** with newly created Bitcoin.

This reward is important — because it’s how new Bitcoin enters circulation. But here’s the catch:\
👉 **There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.**\
That number is **fixed forever**, written into Bitcoin’s code. No one — not a government, company, or individual — can create more.

Right now, not all of the 21 million Bitcoin have been released. The process of **mining** — doing the Proof of Work — slowly releases new Bitcoin over time as a reward. This happens in a predictable schedule and will continue until the very last Bitcoin is mined around the year **2140**.

## **4. Why Bitcoin Is the Hardest Money Ever Created**

In monetary terms, “**hardness**” refers to how difficult it is to increase the supply of money. The **harder** the money, the **more resistant it is to inflation or dilution**.

Let’s compare:

* **Gold** is scarce — but not fixed. Miners extract more gold every year, adding about **1–2% to the total supply annually**.

* **Fiat money** (like the U.S. dollar) is the softest. It can be created at will, with no limit.

* **Bitcoin** is the **hardest money ever invented**:

  * The total supply is forever capped at 21 million.

  * The rate of creation cuts in half every four years.

  * No one can change this schedule.

This makes Bitcoin the first **truly scarce asset** in human history — not just physically scarce like gold, but **mathematically and absolutely scarce**.

### Why does this matter?

Because it changes the very nature of money. Instead of being something that loses value over time, Bitcoin becomes **a form of property** — a way to store your labor, your time, your effort — across generations.

* It encourages **saving, not spending out of fear of inflation**.

* It rewards **patience and stewardship**, not speculation and debt.

* It teaches **long-term thinking**, a concept deeply woven into Scripture (Proverbs 13:22: *“A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children”*).

***

## **5. Why Does This Matter for Christianity?**

Christianity affirms that creation is good, work is sacred, and truth matters.

In Genesis, God gave Adam a task — to **work the garden**. Work is not a curse. It’s part of what it means to bear God’s image.

Bitcoin’s Proof of Work aligns with this:

* It says value comes from **real effort**, not manipulation.

* It links **truth to time** — just as God’s Word unfolds through history.

* It **defends against corruption** — just as the Kingdom of God resists the lies of Babylon.

* It places a **limit on excess** — just as Sabbath and Jubilee rhythms place a brake on endless exploitation.

In contrast, fiat systems reward those closest to the money printers — often the rich or powerful — while devaluing the labor of ordinary people. That’s why Bitcoin has been called “money for the people” — because anyone, anywhere, can use it without asking permission.

## **6. The Victorious Gospel: A Bigger Redemption**

The **Victorious Gospel** teaches that Jesus didn’t just save individual souls. He came to **restore all things** — including how we live, build, work, and relate to each other.

That means we care about justice, truth, dignity, and creation itself. And it means we seek tools that reflect those values.

Bitcoin isn’t the Gospel. But it **rhymes** with it:

* It honors work, like God does.

* It respects time, like Scripture does.

* It tells the truth, like Jesus does.

* It has **limits**, just as the Sabbath, Creation, and grace all have defined edges.

* And it **stores value** — the value of human time and labor — like good soil stores seed.

***

## **7. But Isn’t Bitcoin Just for Rich Tech People?**

Actually, the opposite is true.

Bitcoin doesn’t care who you are. It doesn’t ask for ID. It doesn’t need a bank. A farmer in El Salvador, a refugee in Ukraine, or a pastor in Nigeria can all use it the same as a Wall Street investor.

It’s global, permissionless, and **radically equal** — not because it’s utopian, but because it’s built on *truth, not trust.*

And that makes it a powerful tool for Christians who care about **freedom, fairness, and flourishing**.

***

## **8. Final Thoughts: Proof of Work and the Work of Christ**

When Jesus died on the cross, He said: *“It is finished.”* That was not just poetry. It was **proof** — that the work was done. That redemption had been secured.

In a small way, Bitcoin reflects that kind of finality:

* Once a block is written, it cannot be undone.

* Once work is proven, it stands as a record.

* Once grace is given, it cannot be revoked.

We don’t need to “stake” our claims based on how much power or status we hold (as in Proof of Stake). We rest in what has been **proven**.

That’s why many Christians — especially those who believe in a **victorious, world-restoring Gospel** — are finding in Bitcoin a tool that aligns with their deepest values.\

## Summary

**Bitcoin** is not just “internet money.” It’s a response to a broken system.\
**Proof of Work** means truth is earned, not claimed.\
**Fiat money** is manipulable and inflationary; Bitcoin is fixed and fair.\
**Bitcoin is the hardest money in history** — with a supply cap of 21 million.\
It appreciates over time, acting as a new form of **digital property**.\
**Christianity** calls us to honest scales, faithful stewardship, and dignified work.\
And the **Victorious Gospel** declares that Jesus is restoring all things — including how we steward value, time, and trust.

Bitcoin may not be the final answer. But it’s a faithful step in the right direction.
