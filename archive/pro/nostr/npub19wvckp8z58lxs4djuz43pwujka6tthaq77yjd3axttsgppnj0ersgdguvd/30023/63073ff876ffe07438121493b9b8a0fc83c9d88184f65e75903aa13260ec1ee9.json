  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - August 24, 2025\n\nA lot of people try to solve income fragility by stacking side hustles — Uber at night, freelancing on platforms, gig apps for everything else.\n\nIt feels like diversification. In practice, it’s just multiple leashes instead of one:\n\n- All fiat-denominated (and fiat bleeds value every year).\n- Platform risk remains (ban one account, and that stream vanishes).\n- Time is still the bottleneck — more gigs = fewer hours, not more freedom.\n- Most gigs don’t compound. When you stop, the income stops.\n\n**Sovereign income ≠ more gigs.** It means streams that can’t be turned off, denominated in hard money, compounding even when you step away.\n\nThis theme connects to today’s gated article, “Sovereign ≠ Decentralized,” where I explore how true sovereignty goes beyond surface-level decentralization.",
