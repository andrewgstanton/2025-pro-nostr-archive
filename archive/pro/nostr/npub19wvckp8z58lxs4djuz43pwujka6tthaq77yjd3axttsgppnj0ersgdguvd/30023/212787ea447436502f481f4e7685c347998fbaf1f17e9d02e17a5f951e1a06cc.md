A seed without soil cannot grow. A soil without nutrients cannot sustain life.

Fiat is sand. It shifts, erodes, and swallows effort whole. The time you spend today is washed away tomorrow. The labor you give is diluted by inflation. Seeds fall, but they find no root.

Bitcoin is fertile ground. It honors scarcity, protects effort, and nourishes growth. A single act — stacking sats, building openly, speaking freely — becomes a seed planted in soil that remembers.

From this soil, sovereignty grows into generosity. Builders rise to shape new frontiers. Hope blooms not because someone decreed it, but because life always seeks a way to flourish.

The garden of tomorrow will not be built by walls, but by seeds planted in honest soil.
