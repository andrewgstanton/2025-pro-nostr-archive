  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 26, 2025\n\nLight is the first word God ever spoke into existence.  \n“Let there be light.”  \nBefore land, before life, before even the passage of time, there was illumination — the permission for things to be seen.  \n\nOn the Moon, light behaves differently.  \nThere’s no air to scatter it, no atmosphere to soften its edges.  \nShadows are pitch black; sunlight is blinding white.  \nIt’s a place where light is pure, and darkness absolute.  \n\nI sometimes think our own hearts are like that — airless places where truth strikes with unbearable clarity.\n  \nOn Earth, we live under a sky of diffusion; light reaches us filtered through atmosphere and cloud, softened enough to bear. \n \nBut when God’s light touches us directly, it reveals every contour, every flaw.  \nThat’s why grace is necessary: not to dim the light, but to make us able to stand in it.  \n\nAs a builder and dreamer, I’m fascinated by how light defines space.\n  \nEvery habitat, every dome, every story or code block in Continuum is really a vessel for light — written, symbolic, spiritual. \n \nWhen we design systems that honor transparency and integrity, we’re echoing that first creative act: separating light from darkness.  \n\nMaybe that’s why I can’t separate faith from engineering. \n \nEvery circuit feels like a prayer; every algorithm, a kind of confession.  \nTo design for truth is to design for light.  \n\nIf humanity ever builds cities on the Moon, we’ll have to re-engineer our relationship to illumination.  \nTwo weeks of daylight, two weeks of night.\n  \nEnergy must be stored; power rationed; the rhythm of life rewritten around a cycle of scarcity and abundance. \n \nThat’s a mirror of the spiritual life too: times of radiance and times of shadow, both ordained, both necessary.  \n\nWhen I think of that, the weight of light feels real. \n \nIt carries memory, direction, revelation. \n \nPhotons that left ancient stars billions of years ago now strike our eyes; perhaps, in some distant future, light reflected from a lunar dome will return to Earth, whispering that we made it — that we carried the flame outward without extinguishing its source.  \n\nIf that’s true, then the calling of this age isn’t to chase brightness for its own sake, but to bear it wisely.\n  \nLight without humility becomes blindness. \n \nLight with grace becomes vision.  \n\nAnd maybe that’s all stewardship ever was:  \nnot ownership, but the art of carrying light — faithfully, carefully — into the dark.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
