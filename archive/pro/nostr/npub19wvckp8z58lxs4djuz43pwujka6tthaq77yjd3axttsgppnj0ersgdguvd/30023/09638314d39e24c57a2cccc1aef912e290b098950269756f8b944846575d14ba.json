  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - May 26, 2025\n\nToday I pause — not to celebrate, but to remember.\\\nMemorial Day is a reminder that freedom always comes at a cost. Not theoretical. Not digital. Real. Blood-bought. Passed down.\n\nI didn’t earn the liberties I have. Someone else paid for them.\\\nThe least I can do is *steward them well* — in how I live, build, and speak.\n\nTomorrow, I head to Bitcoin 2025.\\\nI go not just as a Bitcoiner, but as someone who believes Bitcoin, when rightly understood, calls us back to **truth**, **cost**, and **accountability**.\\\nNot magic internet money. Not another tech trend.\\\nBut a reckoning.\n\nSo I walk into this week with both gratitude and resolve:\n\n* Grateful for those who gave their lives.\n\n* Grateful for the freedom to write, build, and think out loud.\n\n* Resolved to use that freedom wisely — and to build systems that don't require bloodshed to sustain them.\n\nLet’s build what lasts.\\\nLet’s remember what was paid.\\\nLet’s walk into Bitcoin 2025 with clear eyes and full hearts.",

      "As Memorial Day invites sober reflection on freedom and sacrifice, I pause to honor what was given — and consider what I’m building toward. This week I head to Bitcoin 2025 not just as a Bitcoiner, but as someone seeking to live with conviction. This is a call to remember the cost of liberty and to build systems rooted in truth, transparency, and work that lasts."
