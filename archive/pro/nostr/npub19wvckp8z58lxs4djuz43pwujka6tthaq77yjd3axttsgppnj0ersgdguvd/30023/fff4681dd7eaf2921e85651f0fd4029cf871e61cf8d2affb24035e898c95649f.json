      "This wasn’t a dramatic comeback. It was quieter than that — a slow return to something I never truly left.\n\nBitcoin didn’t lure me back. It waited — with proof, not promises.\nReading The Bitcoin Standard reframed not just money, but time, trust, and work itself.\nI stopped chasing. I started pruning. I began rebuilding — from conviction, not consensus.\n\nSometimes returning isn’t about going backward.\nIt’s about finally going deeper.\n\n"

  "content": "never fully left Bitcoin. But for a while, I treated it like an asset — not a foundation.\n\nIt sat quietly in the background while I explored ecosystems that promised more features, more flexibility, more “community.” But the deeper I went into Web3, the more I realized what I was missing: clarity. Conviction. Limits that meant something.\n\nBitcoin never sold me hype. It just sat there, silently verifying everything.\n\n***\n\nWhen I finally returned to it — not as an asset, but as a *philosophy* — it wasn’t with fanfare.\\\nIt was more like waking up in a room I had forgotten I built.\n\nReading *The Bitcoin Standard* didn’t just shift how I think about money.\\\nIt reframed how I saw time, trust, and value itself.\n\n&gt; Fiat incentivizes urgency.\\\n&gt; Bitcoin forces patience.\\\n&gt; Fiat rewards noise.\\\n&gt; Bitcoin rewards work.\n\nIt hit me: I had been operating with fiat assumptions in more areas than I wanted to admit — not just in trading or investing, but in how I approached relationships, goals, even faith.\n\n***\n\nI started pruning.\n\nI stopped trading altcoins altogether.\\\nI stopped measuring success in dollars and started thinking in sats.\\\nI stepped out of endless Discord threads and Telegram pings — and felt *relief* I hadn’t known I needed.\n\nI started building more quietly.\\\nAnd more honestly.\n\nEven in my non-financial life, things began to change.\\\nLow time preference showed up in how I approached relationships.\\\nIn how I treated rest.\\\nIn how I stopped chasing every new opportunity and started focusing on *stewardship* — of capital, energy, and attention.\\\nAnd I’ve been trying to become more patient — though I think that’s more the Holy Spirit’s work in me than Bitcoin’s.\n\n***\n\nIn some ways, it wasn’t just a return.\\\nIt was a repentance.\n\nA turning away from the illusion of infinite leverage, and back toward a system that demanded real cost.\\\nBitcoin doesn’t flatter. It disciplines.\\\nAnd that’s exactly what I needed.\n\n***\n\nI didn’t need to be early to the next thing.\\\nI needed to go deeper with the one thing that still made sense.\n\nBitcoin didn’t need me to return.\\\nBut I’m grateful I did.\n\n***\n\n⚡ If this resonates, zap me some sats — or share it forward.\\\n🤖 Drafted with the help of ChatGPT, who never once tried to sell me a token.\n\n\\#ProofOfWork #BitcoinNotCrypto #TheReturn #StillBuilding #LowTimePreference #TimeNotTokens\n",
