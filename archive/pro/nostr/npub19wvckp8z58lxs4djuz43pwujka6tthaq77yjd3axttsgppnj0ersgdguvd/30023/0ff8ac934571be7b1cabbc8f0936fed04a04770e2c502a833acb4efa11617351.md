Mars is not the Moon. The distance to Earth ranges from 54 million to over 400 million kilometers, which means a signal takes anywhere from 4 to 22 minutes to travel one way. That changes everything.

On Earth, Bitcoin works because nodes can stay in near real-time sync. On Mars, that’s impossible. By the time a Martian miner hears about a new block, Earth has already moved on. Mining directly against Earth’s hash power becomes hopeless.

So what happens? Mars must adapt.

Local Martian colonies would still run full nodes, but their role shifts:

- On-chain settlement  with Earth becomes periodic, not continuous.
- Lightning channels flourish locally, powering daily trade in domes and dust-swept cities.
- Interplanetary settlements might happen once a week or month, where big transactions are batched and sent Earthward for anchoring.

This isn’t a weakness. It’s sovereignty. Mars would not be an Earth debt-colony, forever dependent on Earth’s currency. By running Bitcoin locally, Martians declare: we will live by the same rules, even at a distance.

In fact, the latency may protect them. No Earth politician, no Earth central bank can suddenly inflate Martian sats. The red planet’s economy would be locally sovereign but globally connected, secured by the same genesis, the same 21 million cap.

Mars forces us to see Bitcoin not just as global money, but as interplanetary money. Rules fixed in physics. Trustless even across the stars.

And if Mars can do it, so can the asteroid belt.
