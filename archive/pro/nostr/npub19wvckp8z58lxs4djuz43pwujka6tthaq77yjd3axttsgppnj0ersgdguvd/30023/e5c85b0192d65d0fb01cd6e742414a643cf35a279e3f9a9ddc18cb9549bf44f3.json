      "The Parable of Bitcoin explores how Bitcoin functions not just as technology, but as a modern parable of truth, value, sacrifice, and incorruptibility. Like treasure hidden in a field or a mustard seed that grows into shelter, Bitcoin reveals deeper realities: freedom requires cost, truth cannot be counterfeited, and enduring conviction matters more than early fortune. It is not the Kingdom, but it points toward the Kingdom — a signpost of incorruptible truth in a world of lies."

  "content": "Jesus spoke in parables --- ordinary stories that revealed extraordinary\ntruths. A seed, a coin, a treasure hidden in a field.\n\nBitcoin is not the Kingdom of God. But it is a parable. A story written\nin code and history, pointing to truth, value, sacrifice, and\nincorruptibility.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Treasure Hidden in a Field\n\nIn 2010, 10,000 bitcoins bought two pizzas. At the time, it looked\ntrivial. Yet that trade marked the first moment incorruptible money\nentered the marketplace.\n\nBitcoin was like treasure buried in plain sight. The world ignored it.\nBut those with eyes to see gave up much to claim it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Mustard Seed\n\nIt began small: a whitepaper on a mailing list, obscure forums, no press\ncoverage. Yet the seed grew --- quietly, steadily, unstoppably.\n\nWhat looked weak became a shelter for millions: Venezuelans escaping\nhyperinflation, Nigerians bypassing broken banks, ordinary people\nreclaiming sovereignty.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Cost of Truth\n\nTruth always carries a cost. Forgiveness is free to the forgiven, but\ncostly to the forgiver.\n\nBitcoin runs on proof-of-work --- costly, unforgeable, rooted in\nreality. No free ride. No counterfeit. No decree that can bypass it.\n\nThe Cross was the ultimate proof of work. Bitcoin mirrors the principle\nin miniature: freedom requires cost.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Coins Left Untouched\n\nSatoshi mined about a million bitcoins. Enough to make him the\nwealthiest person alive. Yet those coins have never moved.\n\nPerhaps he died. Perhaps he walked away. Either way, the untouched\nfortune itself is a parable: treasure surrendered so the system could\nremain incorruptible.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Unforkable Truth\n\nAltcoins have tried to copy Bitcoin. Some promise faster, smarter,\ngreener. All fail.\n\nBecause you can fork code, but not history. You can copy software, but\nnot incorruptibility.\n\nBitcoin is the printing press --- a civilizational breakthrough.\nAltcoins are carnival tickets and junk mail. They may amuse, but they\nare not the revolution.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Altcoins as Test Nets\n\nAnd yet, even failed experiments serve a purpose. Altcoins are test nets\nwith economic skin in the game. They reveal human behavior, test fragile\nideas, and --- mostly --- prove why Bitcoin's design endures.\n\nTheir collapse strengthens the parable. Every failure points back to the\none foundation that holds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Paradox of Late Conviction\n\nI wish I had this clarity in 2016. Bitcoin was under \\$1,000. The noise\nof altcoins was deafening.\n\nBut here is the paradox: early wealth without understanding is fragile.\nLate conviction with understanding is unshakable.\n\nEarly entry builds fortune. Late conviction builds endurance. And\nBitcoin is about enduring truth.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Bitcoin as Providence\n\nIts timing is uncanny: released after the 2008 crash exposed fiat's\nrot.\\\nIts founder: anonymous, immune to bribes, untouchable by power.\\\nIts design: incorruptible, unfakeable, unforkable.\n\nCoincidence? Or providence? Like the printing press before the\nReformation, Bitcoin arrived as if seeded into history exactly when the\nworld needed it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Conclusion: The Parable Lives\n\nParables take ordinary things --- seeds, coins, treasure --- and reveal\neternal truths.\n\nBitcoin, too, is a parable: of treasure hidden until revealed, of\nfreedom that requires cost, of incorruptible truth that endures beyond\nits giver.\n\nIt is not the gospel. But it is a signpost toward the gospel, for those\nwith ears to hear.\n\nBitcoin is the parable of truth in a world of lies. And the parable is\nstill being told.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis piece was developed with the help of Dr. C (ChatGPT) in dialogue, refining ideas into written form.\n\nI write not for my own glory, but to bring glory to the Name of Christ — the Truth to which all parables ultimately point.",
