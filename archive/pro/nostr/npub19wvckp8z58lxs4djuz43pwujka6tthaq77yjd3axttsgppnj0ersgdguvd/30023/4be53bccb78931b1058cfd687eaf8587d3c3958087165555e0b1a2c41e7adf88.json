  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 9, 2025  \n\nThe world calls it an “economy,” but that word once meant stewardship — the management of a household. Somewhere along the way, we turned it into a contest. We began measuring worth by accumulation, productivity, growth. Even our faith communities started speaking the same language: “maximizing impact,” “leveraging influence,” “scaling ministry.” Yet the gospel runs on a different logic — an economy of grace.\n\nGrace doesn’t scale. It multiplies. It doesn’t reward the strongest player; it feeds the weakest. It flows toward need, not achievement. Every miracle of provision in Scripture follows the same pattern: something small is offered, and something infinite returns. The widow’s oil. The boy’s lunch. The loaves and fishes. The pattern is always grace meeting honesty.\n\nWe think provision begins with supply. But grace teaches the opposite: provision begins with trust. “Seek first the Kingdom,” Jesus said, “and all these things will be added to you.” He didn’t promise abundance as a prize for obedience; He promised sufficiency as a side effect of love.\n\nThat’s hard to believe in an algorithmic age. The market rewards precision and control, not trust. But grace isn’t a transaction; it’s a release. The moment we stop clutching outcomes, we rediscover the original economy: where generosity circulates like oxygen, and no one suffocates for lack of metrics.\n\nI’ve watched this play out in real life — a friend gives when it makes no sense, and somehow receives more than he gave. A project collapses, only to uncover a calling. The logic of grace can’t be modeled on a spreadsheet, because it refuses to be optimized. It only works when it’s lived.\n\nProvision isn’t proof of success. It’s proof of relationship. God’s economy is personal — every account is reconciled by hand.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
