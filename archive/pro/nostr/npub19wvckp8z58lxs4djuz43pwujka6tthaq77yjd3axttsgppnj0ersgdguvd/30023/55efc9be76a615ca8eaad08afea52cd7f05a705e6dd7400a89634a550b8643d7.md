### 🌋 *Ka ʻImi i ka Pono: Seeking What’s Right*

**A 7-Day Series on Sovereignty, Bitcoin, and the Soul of the Islands**

&gt; *"Man is not free unless he wills to be free."*\
&gt; — Johann Gottlieb Fichte

Hawai‘i understands sovereignty. It always has.\
But it was taken — first with pen and politics, then with force and fiat.

Bitcoin offers something different:\
A way to reclaim sovereignty without violence.\
A tool for self-rule, not state rule.\
A system built not on empire, but on truth and time.

This week, I’ll be posting a 7-part series exploring this tension:\
Between the Hawai‘i that *was*, the system that *is*, and the future that *might be* — if we choose to *build on bedrock instead of paper*.

I don’t know if there’s a traditional Hawaiian word for a 7-day week — maybe there doesn’t need to be.\
Time moves differently on these islands.\
But for the next 7 days, I’ll mark each reflection as a kind of modern *lā hoʻomanaʻo* — a day of remembering, reckoning, and restoring.

This is personal. It’s philosophical. It’s also unfinished.

But that’s what sovereignty looks like:\
*Not something given — something reclaimed.*

Stay tuned. Stay akamai.\
