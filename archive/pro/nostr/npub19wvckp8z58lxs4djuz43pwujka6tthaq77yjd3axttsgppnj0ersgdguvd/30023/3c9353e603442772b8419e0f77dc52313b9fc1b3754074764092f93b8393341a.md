Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 27, 2025

Faith does not always roar. Sometimes it simply stays.
When medicine has said all it can say and the body has become a map of exhaustion, faith becomes presence — nothing more, nothing less.

I watched my father fade and realized how many prayers we mistake for noise. True prayer is attention. It listens more than it speaks. It trusts without demanding. It holds vigil.

We often think of miracles as interruptions of nature, but perhaps the deeper miracle is endurance — the quiet grace that keeps us from breaking when everything in us wants to run.

That night, I sat by his bed and whispered psalms I barely understood, not to change the outcome but to steady my heart. Each verse felt like a handrail in the dark. God was not absent; He was patient — waiting for me to stop performing and start believing.

Faith is the art of remaining. It’s what keeps the candle burning when the oil is almost gone.
