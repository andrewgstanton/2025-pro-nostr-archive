Stanton - Nov. 25, 2025\n\nThere is a unique exhaustion that comes from carrying weight that does not technically belong to you.\n\nNot the weight of responsibility — that can be noble.  \nNot the weight of purpose — that can be energizing.  \nBut the weight of **other people’s unresolved issues**, the dead space where they refuse to stand up in their own story.\n\nIt’s the weight that pools on your shoulders when you feel responsible for “keeping it all together,” even though you were never asked — or worse, were asked only because you actually do it.\n\nWhat wears you down is not the task itself, but the **asymmetry** of effort.  \nYou show up.  \nOthers… don’t.\n\nAnd when you name the effort you’ve invested, you don’t want credit — you just want acknowledgment. Not praise. Not applause. **Just recognition that you carried your weight and didn’t disappear.**\n\nYet that simple acknowledgment is often what people fail to give.\n\n### The strange loneliness of being the steady one\n\nPeople who are emotionally steady tend to become invisible.  \nNot because others don’t value them, but because others assume they’ll always be fine.\n\nSo your consistency becomes a curse.  \nYour reliability becomes a vacuum.  \nYour strength becomes the very thing people exploit — consciously or not.\n\nThis creates a deep loneliness.  \nA resentment you don’t want to feel, but it shows up anyway.\n\nBecause you aren’t asking for much.  \nYou aren’t asking for parades.  \nYou’re asking for **reciprocity**.\n\nAnd reciprocity — even in its simplest form — is one of the rarest currencies in human relationships.\n\n### The spiritual truth: God sees what people ignore\n\nWhen the world overlooks your effort, your faith starts to whisper a counter-truth:\n\n**“Your Father sees in secret.”**\n\nHe sees the extra hours.  \nHe sees the emotional load.  \nHe sees the grace you extend to people who don’t understand the cost.  \nHe sees the quiet obedience when you choose not to retaliate, even when resentment claws at your throat.\n\nYou may not be acknowledged by humans —  \nbut you are **seen by Heaven**.\n\nAnd in the Kingdom economy, nothing done in faith is wasted.\n\n### Sovereignty is not isolation — it’s rightful ownership\n\nThere is a turning point where you stop carrying what isn’t yours.  \nNot out of bitterness,  \nnot out of anger,  \nbut out of clarity.\n\nYou reclaim your boundaries.  \nYou reclaim your emotional bandwidth.  \nYou reclaim the right to not absorb other people’s chaos.\n\nSovereignty looks like:\n\n- refusing to be the dumping ground for other people’s unresolved trauma  \n- saying “no” without apology  \n- letting people face their own consequences  \n- protecting the part of your soul that God entrusted to *you*, not the world\n\nYou can love people deeply without letting them conscript your energy.  \nYou can be compassionate without being responsible for everyone’s instability.  \nYou can be generous without being drained.\n\n### The hidden blessing: this season is shaping your discernment\n\nExhausting seasons have one hidden benefit — they sharpen your discernment.\n\nYou start to see:\n\n- who genuinely values you  \n- who only values what you can provide  \n- who is capable of mutuality  \n- who is allergic to responsibility  \n- who will rise with you  \n- who will resent you for rising  \n\nYou begin to redistribute your energy accordingly.\n\nGod is pruning your relationships, even when it feels like you’re simply surviving another day.\n\n### The encouragement: you are not crazy, needy, or dramatic\n\nYou’re not asking for too much.  \nYou’re asking for what every functional relationship requires: acknowledgment, reciprocity, and shared weight.\n\nAnd if people can’t offer that, it does not diminish your worth — it simply reveals their limitations.\n\nYour strength is not the problem.  \nYour clarity is not the problem.  \nYour desire for mutuality is not the problem.\n\nKeep carrying what’s yours.  \nRelease what isn’t.  \nGod sees.  \nYour work is not invisible.  \nAnd you’re much closer to breakthrough than the silence around you suggests.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
