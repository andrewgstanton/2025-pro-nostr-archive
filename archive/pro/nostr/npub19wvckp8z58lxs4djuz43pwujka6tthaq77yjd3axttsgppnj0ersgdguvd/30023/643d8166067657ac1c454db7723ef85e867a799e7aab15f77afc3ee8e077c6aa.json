  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 2, 2025\n\nMost technology today is disposable. Platforms rise, tokens launch, and hype cycles churn — and then it all fades. MySpace, Friendster, AOL, Yahoo, Skype. Terra/LUNA, EOS, NFTs, FTX. What once looked like ownership is revealed as tenancy. What once looked like permanence is revealed as fashion.\n\nBitcoin is different. It’s cathedral-building: slow, covenantal, sovereign, designed to endure for centuries.\n\n👉 Full Paid article:  *Cathedrals or Casinos — Bitcoin and the End of Disposable Tech*\n\n- 👉 Free Article 1 : *Lessons from Web2: The Rise and Fall of Disposable Platforms*\n- 👉 Free Article 2 : *Web3’s Mirage: Tokens, Ownership, and the Return of Disposability*\n\n🔒 **Full article available for 500 sats.** Zap me and I’ll send it via encrypted DM while I finish building the automated unlock flow in Continuum.",
