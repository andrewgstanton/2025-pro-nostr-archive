  "content": "Beyond Transaction: Recovering the First Thousand Years of Grace\n\nAndrew G. Stanton — Sunday Reflection\n\nFor the first thousand years of Christianity, the gospel was not a contract to sign but a mystery to enter. Grace meant participation — a living union between God and humanity, a transformation of what had fallen into what could be made whole. The early believers spoke of salvation as light, healing, adoption, theosis — the slow, inward process of being made divine by love.\n\nSomewhere along the way, that language was lost. By the eleventh century, grace had been reinterpreted through the logic of empire and the courts: sin became debt, God became judge, and the cross became the place where the balance sheet was settled. What began as communion was reframed as transaction. The tragedy is that both Catholics and Protestants inherited the same framework. The argument between them was never over whether salvation was transactional, but only over how the transaction worked and who had the right to manage it.\n\n1. The Original Vision — Grace as Union\n\nIn the first millennium, the central metaphor of salvation was union.\nIrenaeus wrote of the Incarnation as God recapitulating the human story from within it.\nAthanasius of Alexandria said it in a single, daring sentence: “God became man that man might become God.”\nAugustine, the Cappadocians, Maximus the Confessor, and the desert fathers all described grace as something that transforms rather than merely pardons.\nThe Christian life was not a courtroom drama but a lifelong ascent into divine likeness.\n\nIn that early world, sin was seen less as crime and more as sickness — the distortion of a nature that was still good but wounded. Salvation was therefore healing, not sentencing. The cross was the medicine of immortality, not the settlement of an account. The sacraments, the prayers, the monastic rhythm of silence and service — all of these were ways of participating in the life of Christ, not paying Him back.\n\n2. The Great Shift — Grace as Transaction\n\nBy the eleventh century, the imagination of the West had changed.\nFeudal society organized everything by hierarchy, debt, and honor. Into that world stepped Anselm of Canterbury, who asked a simple but fateful question: Cur Deus Homo? — “Why did God become man?”\nHis answer: because humanity owed God an infinite debt of honor.\nWe could not repay it, so Christ paid it for us.\n\nThat framework fit the age perfectly. God became the feudal Lord, Christ the loyal vassal, humanity the debtor.\nAtonement turned into satisfaction.\nA few centuries later, Calvin sharpened the metaphor further: not just debt repaid, but punishment transferred.\nChrist bore our sentence so the law could be upheld.\nDifferent vocabulary, same economy.\n\nBoth sides of the Reformation shared this model.\nThe Catholic Church managed grace through sacraments and indulgences; Protestants preached it through substitution and decision theology.\nBut underneath both was the same legal logic — sin as liability, grace as payment, salvation as transaction.\n\n3. The Lost Mysticism\n\nIn the process, something luminous was lost.\nThe mystical dimension of grace — the direct experience of God’s indwelling presence — faded from public theology.\nGrace became something to possess rather than live within.\nIt could be administered, withheld, quantified, debated — but rarely felt.\n\nThe result was predictable: fear instead of intimacy, guilt instead of gratitude.\nPeople were told they were free, but still felt condemned.\nThe courtroom had eclipsed the garden.\nAnd yet, through every century, a few voices kept the older current alive:\nJulian of Norwich, Meister Eckhart, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, and later the Quakers, who spoke of the Inner Light that shines in everyone willing to be still long enough to notice it.\n\n4. The Cost of the Transactional Gospel\n\nWhen grace becomes transactional, faith becomes performance.\nWe start measuring devotion by effort, repentance by emotion, and righteousness by comparison.\nThe soul becomes an accountant — tallying merits, weighing sins, negotiating with a God who has already said “paid in full.”\n\nThat posture doesn’t produce holiness; it produces anxiety.\nIt divides rather than unites.\nIt also flattens the mystery of divine love into a moral economy: an infinite God reduced to a cosmic bookkeeper.\n\nThe early mystics and the Eastern fathers never saw it that way.\nFor them, salvation was a relationship restored, not an account settled.\nIt was the life of God flowing through the human vessel again.\nIt required surrender, not calculation.\n\n5. The Way Back — Grace as Participation\n\nRecovering the first thousand years of grace does not mean rejecting what came later.\nThe Reformers gave us moral seriousness and intellectual clarity; the Catholic tradition gave us sacramental beauty and continuity.\nBut we need to reunite both with the mystical heart that came before them.\n\nGrace is not a commodity or a pardon slip.\nIt is participation — Christ in us, the hope of glory.\nIt is not something we receive once but something we continually awaken to.\nIt is not the absence of debt but the presence of love.\n\nTo rediscover this is to remember what the gospel always was:\na call not to believe in a transaction, but to enter a union.\n\n6. Communion, Not Contract\n\nThe language of contract gave structure to theology but starved the soul of mystery.\nFor a millennium, Christians have been trained to think of God as the other party in a moral exchange — one we can neither escape nor fulfill.\nBut that is not the God Jesus revealed.\nHis was the God who eats with sinners, washes feet, and breathes Spirit into dust.\nNot a judge balancing accounts, but a lover seeking communion.\n\nPerhaps grace began to sound too simple, too human, too unmanageable.\nBut that’s the point.\nGrace is not control; it is companionship.\nIt is God choosing to dwell in us before we are ready.\nIt is the divine saying, again and again: you are mine, and I am yours.\n\nThe first thousand years of Christianity knew this by heart.\nMaybe it’s time we remember.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap.
