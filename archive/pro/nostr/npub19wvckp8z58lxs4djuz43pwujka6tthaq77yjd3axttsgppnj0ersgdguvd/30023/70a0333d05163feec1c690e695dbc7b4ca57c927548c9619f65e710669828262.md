Astronomers speak of **supermassive black holes**—cosmic hearts millions of times heavier than the sun, anchoring entire galaxies in orbit. Their gravity bends space itself; nothing that drifts too near can escape. Yet modern physics also tells us a paradox: they are not truly black. They leak radiation. Information is not lost. Even in the deepest darkness, light still finds a way out.  

That image captures something the prophets only saw in flashes and the apostles proclaimed in full:  
> *“For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.”* — Romans 11:36  
> *“He will reconcile to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of His cross.”* — Colossians 1:20  

Creation itself is caught in a **gravity well of grace**. The fall scattered its fragments, but the pull of divine love never slackened. Every story, every atom, every consciousness continues to orbit that center—sometimes violently, sometimes in longing. What we call history is simply the slow spiral inward toward redemption’s event horizon.  

### Judgment and Purification  
To speak of irresistible love does not deny judgment; it deepens it. The fire of holiness is no courtroom sentence—it is *consuming fire* (Hebrews 12:29). It burns away what cannot belong to love until only love remains. In physics, a collapsing star releases unimaginable energy; in theology, the collapse of the self-made ego releases praise. Both are purgation by pressure.  

The early fathers understood this. **Gregory of Nyssa** wrote that evil has no substance of its own; it exists only as distortion, and when divine light fills all, distortion vanishes. **Isaac the Syrian** said, “The love of God works in two ways: it torments sinners as fire and delights the righteous as light.” The same flame, different experience, one purpose—healing creation from the inside out.  

### Freedom and the Long Spiral  
Some object: if every creature is eventually drawn into God, what of free will? But freedom is not destroyed by truth; it is *fulfilled* by it. A spacecraft cannot escape a black hole’s pull, yet inside that field, every motion is still its own. Likewise, the will remains personal even while inevitably returning to its Source. Grace is not coercion; it is *revelation*. When God is finally seen as He is, resistance becomes unthinkable.  

Could that take eons? Perhaps. Scripture hints at “ages of ages,” cosmic spans of mercy unfolding beyond human chronology. But the direction of time is clear:  
> *“As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.”* — 1 Corinthians 15:22  
> *“Every knee will bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.”* — Philippians 2:10–11  

These are not the mechanics of forced allegiance; they are the physics of inevitable adoration. The gravity well of divine love is patient enough to wait through millennia of orbit until each soul yields to its center.  

### The Cross as Singularity  
At the middle of this field stands the Cross—the true singularity where time, matter, and morality collapse into mercy. There all trajectories intersect; there entropy reverses. The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world is also the Alpha and Omega of space-time. From that infinite density of love, resurrection radiation leaks backward and forward through history, announcing that even death cannot conserve its darkness.  

When Jesus cried, *“It is finished,”* He did not mean, *“I have made salvation possible if humans cooperate.”* He meant, *“Reality itself has been re-centered in Me.”* The gravitational constant of creation was recalibrated to grace.  

### Not Sentimental Universalism  
This is not the easy universalism of modern sentiment, where sin dissolves into tolerance. It is the **fierce universalism of the Cross**, where every wrong is judged, every lie exposed, every injustice accounted for—yet the outcome is restoration, not annihilation. Mercy does not deny the furnace; it passes through it and makes it holy.  

Hell, in this view, is not a parallel kingdom; it is the outer turbulence of that same gravity well, the zone where pride still burns in orbit but has not yet surrendered. Even there, the pull remains. The Lamb descends into the depths not to confirm their isolation but to claim them. The harrowing of hell was not a one-time event; it is the ongoing mission of divine love until the last shadow yields.  

### The Universe Leaks Light  
If physics teaches that information cannot be lost, theology proclaims that love cannot fail. Every photon that escapes a black hole’s edge preaches the gospel in miniature: **nothing truly made by God disappears into oblivion.** The universe leaks resurrection.  

What appears as loss—death, decay, despair—is only the visible side of a deeper gravitational process drawing all things home. Paul saw it:  
> *“The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.”* — Romans 8:21  

### Eschatological Horizon  
One day the event horizon itself will evaporate. The veil between heaven and earth, between light and darkness, will collapse into singular clarity:  
> *“Behold, I make all things new.”* — Revelation 21:5  

Then the cosmos will rest in perfect symmetry—no orbit left uncentered, no heart left unmoved. The great gravitational well of grace will no longer pull because nothing remains outside it.  

### Closing  
So I do not fear the darkness. Its pull is not the void’s but Love’s. The same force that binds galaxies binds my soul. Sin resists; grace persists. In the end, everything falls toward the Lamb who sits at the center of all gravity and all glory.
