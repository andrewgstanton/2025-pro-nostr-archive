Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 7, 2025

Luna did not break away from Earth in anger.  
It simply walked a different road.

The Pelagia Compact—signed by representatives of thirteen enclaves, five guild coalitions, the Lakota Collective, and the Freeport Archivists—formalized a truth years in the making:

Luna was a self-governing world.

---

## **I. Why It Happened**
The Compact emerged from several realities:

- UEB could no longer enforce regulation  
- Enclaves ran fully on lunar power  
- Bitcoin settlement replaced Earth credits  
- Circle Law resolved disputes better than terrestrial courts  
- Freeport had become the cultural and intellectual capital of the diaspora  
- Mars had launched Pilgrim-9  

Earth’s relevance had evaporated.

Instead of defiance, the Compact expressed **gratitude**:

> “We honor the world that birthed us,  
> but we must walk in the sovereignty that sustains us.”

---

## **II. What the Compact Actually Said**
It was only 289 words.

Key clauses included:

1. **Guild Autonomy**  
   Guilds are foundational governance units.

2. **Circle Law Supremacy**  
   No external authority overrides Circle Law.

3. **Enclave Self-Determination**  
   Enclaves govern their own affairs.

4. **Freeport Neutrality**  
   Freeport remains independent and unowned.

5. **Open Identity**  
   No registry, census, or unified ID system.

6. **Economic Independence**  
   Bitcoin and local ledgers replace Earth settlement systems.

7. **Non-Aggression**  
   Luna will not attack Earth, nor submit to attack.

The Compact was humble, restrained, and wildly radical.

## **III. Earth’s Response**
UEB declared the Compact:

- unlawful  
- illegitimate  
- destabilizing  
- “a misguided aspiration of loosely organized hobbyists”

But the truth was clear:

Earth had **lost** the Moon years earlier.

The Compact merely formalized the loss.

---

## **IV. Legacy**
The Pelagia Compact became:

- the first sovereign charter born off-world  
- a blueprint for Martian governance  
- the philosophical ancestor of the Sovereign Canon  
- a foundational document of the Archivists’ stewardship  

Martian historians would later write:

> “Earth created colonies.  
> Luna created a civilization.”
