  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 24, 2025\n\n\nThere’s a silence that settles over a house when someone is slowly slipping away.  \nNot the silence of absence — not yet — but the softer kind that forms between conversations, between bites of dinner, between glances toward the bedroom where time has slowed.\n\nWe keep the television on — news, sports, even a series called *Chief of War* — as if a bit of noise could keep the edges of life intact. It doesn’t, but it helps us pretend.\n\nHe lies in bed, weaker each day, refusing food now, no longer doing dialysis. We sit near him, measuring breaths instead of hours. Sometimes we talk; sometimes we just listen — to the hum of the air conditioner, to the flicker of the TV, to the small sounds of a house learning how to say goodbye.\n\nGrief begins here — in the waiting, in the gentle surrender of trying to hold what is already beyond our keeping.  \n\nIt’s not dramatic, not cinematic. It’s slow and strangely ordinary — coffee cups, phone chargers, whispers in the hallway. Yet in that ordinariness, something sacred shines through: love that refuses to vanish, even as the body grows thin and time runs short.\n\nThe weight we carry is not only sadness. It’s gratitude — for breath shared, for presence kept, for love that lingers longer than breath.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
