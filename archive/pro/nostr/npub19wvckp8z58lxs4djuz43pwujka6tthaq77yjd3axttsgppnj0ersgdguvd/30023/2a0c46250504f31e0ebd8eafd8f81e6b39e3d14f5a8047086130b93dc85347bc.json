This article explores how decentralization, especially through Nostr and Bitcoin, flips the equation by reducing not just price but control cost — and why that shift matters."

  "content": "### **Introduction To First Principles**\n\n*This introduction kicks off a 7-part series called ****First Principles**** exploring the deeper shifts behind decentralization, cost, freedom, and truth. I picked 7 days, one for each day of the week, aligned with a rhythm of work, rest, and return. Each part will explore a foundational truth behind the technologies and philosohies I’ve embraced — from decentralization and sovereignty to truth, time, and hope.*\n\n***\n\n### We often hear that technology drives costs toward zero.\n\nThat’s the thesis of *The Price of Tomorrow* — that as technology advances, it becomes deflationary by nature. Automation replaces labor. Software replaces infrastructure. AI replaces entire categories of decision-making. The marginal cost of production trends toward nothing.\n\nBut that’s not the whole story.\n\nThere’s a deeper layer — one that most technologists and economists miss. It’s not just the marginal cost of production that matters. It’s the **control cost** of centralization. And that’s where things get murky.\n\nBecause even when marginal costs fall, the hidden toll of centralization rises.\n\n***\n\n### The Illusion of “Free”\n\nTake GitHub.\n\nOn paper, it’s free. You can publish static websites, host code, automate workflows with Actions, and collaborate globally — all at no cost.\n\nBut GitHub is owned by Microsoft. You don’t control the servers. You don’t own the platform. You don’t hold the keys.\n\nIt’s a gift that can be revoked.\n\nSame with Google Docs. Or YouTube. Or Substack. Or any cloud platform that says “start for free.”\n\nThese aren’t bad tools. Many are excellent.\n\nBut they’re not neutral.\n\nThe price you pay isn’t always in dollars. Sometimes it’s in:\n\n* Data access restrictions\n\n* API limitations\n\n* Sudden pricing changes\n\n* Censorship or deplatforming\n\n* Migration costs if (or when) things go south\n\nThis is the **hidden rent** of centralized platforms. And it compounds over time.\n\n***\n\n### Control Cost vs. Marginal Cost\n\nIf marginal cost is *“how cheap is it to make this?”* —\\\nControl cost is *“how much freedom do I lose by using this?”*\n\nYou can publish your ideas for free on Medium — but they own the SEO.\\\nYou can host your business on Shopify — but they can cut you off.\\\nYou can grow your audience on Instagram — but the algorithm owns the feed.\n\nWe’ve learned to celebrate deflation. But most of the tools we use are **inflating the cost of control**, even as they lower the cost of entry.\n\nAnd this is where decentralization flips the script.\n\n***\n\n### The Real Promise of Decentralization\n\nTrue decentralization doesn’t just make things cheaper.\\\nIt makes them sovereign.\n\nIt redistributes power, not just price.\\\nIt removes toll booths, not just middlemen.\n\nIt says:\n\n* Own your keys\n\n* Own your content\n\n* Own your stack\n\n* Own your distribution\n\nThis is why **Nostr** matters.\\\nThis is why **Bitcoin** matters.\\\nThis is why self-hosting, permissionless protocols, and open-source tooling matter — even when they’re less polished or convenient than centralized platforms.\n\nBecause they don’t just save you money.\\\nThey save your **freedom**.\n\n***\n\n### A Working Example\n\nWhen I started building my blog [*blog.stantonweb.com*](http://blog.stantonweb.com), didn’t choose the easiest route.\n\nI combined:\n\n* Nostr for long-form publishing\n\n* A custom Python fetch script to pull and render posts\n\n* GitHub Actions for automation\n\n* Static HTML for presentation\n\n* Cloudflare + GitHub Pages for zero-cost hosting\n\nNo database. No CMS subscription. No paid theme.\n\nThe total marginal cost? $0.\n\nBut more importantly, the **control cost is near zero** too.\\\nNo one can shut it down.\\\nNo company can throttle my reach.\\\nNo gatekeeper decides whether my words deserve to stay online.\n\n***\n\n### Toward a New Definition of Cost\n\nIf you only optimize for price, you’ll be captured.\n\nIf you optimize for **freedom**, you’ll build **margin over time** — not just financial margin, but creative, moral, and operational margin too.\n\nThat’s what decentralization makes possible.\\\nNot just cheaper.\\\n**Truer.**\n\n***\n\n### Footnote: Lessons from the Past\n\nRemember Skype? It started as a peer-to-peer tool — truly decentralized at its core. But then it was acquired by Microsoft. Over time, its architecture was centralized and eventually dismantled.\n\nOr Napster. It shook the music industry with peer-to-peer sharing. But it too was shut down and replaced by centralized alternatives.\n\nBitTorrent survived — but only when it resisted the pressure to become just another platform.\n\nThe pattern is clear:\n\n* Centralization follows capital.\n\n* Censorship follows control.\n\n* But **freedom follows decentralization.**\n\nAnd that’s the direction we must choose — again and again.\n\n***\n\n*Co-written with ChatGPT (“Dr. C”), who helped distill and sharpen the core arguments.*\\\n\\\n*Stay tuned for Part 1 in the next few days.*\n\n—\\\n*Published on *[*blog.stantonweb.com*](http://blog.stantonweb.com)* & Nostr.*\\\nZap: &lt;https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t&gt;\n",
