Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 17, 2025

I’ve always been awkward about asking for support.

Maybe it’s pride. Maybe it’s the years I spent as a “self-reliant” entrepreneur. Maybe it’s the subtle shame of feeling like if I were really successful, I wouldn’t have to ask.

But reality doesn’t care about my pride.

Hosting costs money.
Time is finite.
My family needs to eat while I’m building cathedrals that don’t pay like a SaaS startup.

So I’ve been talking more openly about patronage—about this $250 package (or sats with a discount) that helps fund Continuum and, indirectly, the life I’m building with Kiyomi.

The question I keep coming back to is simple:

> **What does patronage actually *buy*?**

If you’re going to support someone, you deserve a clear answer.

### Patronage buys time that can’t be rented back

In the fiat world, time is constantly rented out in tiny slices:

- Hourly wages.  
- Contract gigs.  
- Upwork projects.  
- Deliverables, invoices, timesheets.

I’ve done all of that. I still do some of it when I have to.

But the kind of work I’m doing with Continuum—building a sovereign publishing and identity layer on Nostr, writing long-form essays that don’t fit neatly into “content marketing,” experimenting with archives and SHA-256 proofs—that work doesn’t map well to billable hours.

It’s exploratory. It’s architectural. It’s deeply unsexy from a short-term ROI perspective.

Patronage isn’t paying me to “write one more blog post.”  
It’s buying blocks of time that are protected from the constant pressure to monetize every hour.

When I know there’s at least some baseline support, I can:

- Spend a day building an export script that syncs Nostr events to a static archive.  
- Experiment with new identity flows without asking, “Will this make money this week?”  
- Sit down to write a difficult essay instead of chasing the next short-term gig.

You don’t just fund hours.
You fund *decisions*.

### Patronage buys resilience against compromise

There’s a reason so much of the internet feels fake and hollow: most creators are financially cornered into chasing algorithms and sponsors, whether they admit it or not.

I’ve tasted that pressure.

It whispers things like:

- “If you just tone down the Bitcoin conviction, you might get more mainstream sponsors.”  
- “If you embrace Web3 buzzwords, you’ll be easier to fund.”  
- “If you write shorter, more clickable pieces, maybe the platforms will reward you.”

Patronage is one of the few tools that pushes back.

When even a small group of people says, “I believe in what you’re doing; here’s real support,” it becomes much easier to say:

- No to VC money that would eventually distort the mission.  
- No to token schemes that look lucrative but violate first principles.  
- No to rewriting my convictions to fit someone else’s narrative of “human flourishing.”

In that sense, patronage is not charity.  
It’s risk capital for integrity.

### Patronage buys infrastructure that doesn’t belong to anyone else

Right now, Continuum is not just a notebook. It’s:

- A local app that manages multiple Nostr identities.  
- A relay-fetching system that mirrors my events into a SQLite database.  
- Export scripts that generate static HTML, Markdown, and PDFs.  
- A growing archive hosted outside the big web platforms.

None of that runs on magic.

- Relays cost money to host.  
- Fly.io or other infrastructure costs money.  
- Even GitHub Pages has limits that I have to work around with time and creativity.

When you support me as a patron, you’re helping pay for the parts of the system that *don’t* show up in the writing itself:

- The backup scripts that make sure a single relay outage doesn’t eat my work.  
- The tools that let me publish once and mirror everywhere.  
- The experiments in sovereign login, Nostr-based identity, and self-hosted dashboards.

You are literally helping build the pipes.

### Patronage buys continuity in the middle of chaos

This has been a chaotic year: hospital visits, family tensions, trading swings, mortgage stress, and the constant emotional drain of feeling like you’re pushing a boulder uphill while almost nobody notices.

There were days when the only reason I kept publishing was stubbornness.
There were other days when the only reason I *could* keep publishing was that someone had already said, “I’ve got your back.”

Patronage doesn’t remove the chaos.
But it gives it a spine.

It turns:

> “I’m trying to do this alone.”

into:

> “I’m still responsible, but I’m not unsupported.”

That’s a big difference.

### If you’re considering it

If you’ve read enough of my work to know that:

- You care about sovereignty.  
- You’re tired of walled gardens.  
- You don’t want “digital flourishing” to be yet another slogan.  
- You’d like to see Continuum exist as a real alternative, not just a thought experiment.

Then yes, your patronage matters.

Not just because it “helps me out,” but because it buys the kind of time, integrity, and infrastructure that can’t be funded by ads or token airdrops without compromising the whole point.

And if you’re not in a position to support financially right now, that’s okay. Truly.

Reading, sharing, praying for us, sending an encouraging note—these all matter more than LinkedIn likes or algorithmic engagement.

But I wanted to be clear, for anyone who *is* able:

When you become a patron, you’re not just buying a “thank you” section.

You’re buying continuity, sovereignty, and the freedom for me to keep building this in the right direction—even when the numbers don’t make sense yet.
