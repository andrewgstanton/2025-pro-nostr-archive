Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 26, 2025

Five hundred years after a wooden ship crossed the Atlantic in search of a freer life, human beings now gather on another world — under another sky — to honor the same truth.

Martian Thanksgiving is not folklore.  
It is not cultural inheritance.  
It is not Earth nostalgia.

It is a recognition that the Mayflower was never about America.  
It was about *human nature* — the part of us that refuses to be ruled by systems that treat individuals as inputs.

The colonists of New Lakota and New Bern do not venerate the Mayflower as a national story but as a *sovereign archetype*. The vessel itself is irrelevant. The courage is not.

And on Mars, the courage matters more than ever.

## **The Mayflower and the Martian Exodus**

The founders of New Lakota did not cross an ocean.  
Their ancestors crossed continents, borders, and eventually the vacuum between worlds.

The founders of New Bern did not leave a monarchy.  
They left a planetary administration — the United Earth Bureau — whose reach grew only as the legitimacy of fiat systems collapsed.

When the UEB attempted to nullify the Martian Referendum of 2115, they repeated the same mistake empires make at the end of their lifecycle:

They mistook their power for permanence.

But sovereignty is not granted by institutions.  
It is claimed by communities.

The Mayflower was a symbol of this claim.  
The Martian Exodus made it real at planetary scale.

## **New Lakota: A People Who Know the Cost of Displacement**

New Lakota was formed by sovereign diaspora groups whose ancestors had been pushed aside by centuries of centralized governance on Earth. The founders brought with them a fierce clarity:

- A people without sovereignty cannot protect their culture.  
- A community without land cannot secure its future.  
- A civilization without memory cannot survive empire.

Every Thanksgiving, New Lakota holds the **Circle of Remembrance**, where settlers recall the Earth communities that inspired them — Hilo, Puerto Esperanza, El Dorado — and the ancestors who endured centuries of forced assimilation.

The Mayflower is not their story.  
But its courage is.

## **New Bern: Democracy Without Hierarchy**

New Bern’s founders came from Earth’s last pockets of direct democracy — Swiss cantons, Alpine free cities, and small cooperatives in the Andes and Atacama Corridor.

To them, the Mayflower is not a national myth.  
It is a reminder that communities must be built from the bottom up.

They celebrate Thanksgiving with the **Cantonal Feast**, a ritual that honors each family’s contribution to the colony’s governance. No hierarchy. No officials. No imposed authority.

Just voices — and voluntary alignment.

## **The UEB Incident and the Second Crossing**

In 2119, the UEB attempted to reassert control by:

- invalidating the Mars independence vote  
- freezing interplanetary resource credits  
- ordering identity registration for all Martian adults  
- threatening sanctions against Luna Freeport

The result was not rebellion.  
The result was *the Second Crossing* — a spontaneous alignment of sovereign communities across the Solar Frontier.

New Lakota refused.  
New Bern refused.  
Luna Freeport refused.  
Ceres refused.  
The Belt Stations refused.

The Mayflower’s courage became a living memory.

## **500 Years Later**

Thanksgiving is where the resonance becomes visible.

It is when the people of Mars acknowledge that:

- Sovereignty is a journey, not a status.  
- Freedom is a covenant, not a law.  
- Memory is a shield against the return of empire.

The Mayflower sailed once.  
But the courage it represented has crossed a thousand frontiers.

Mars is only the latest —  
not the last.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.

## Zaps Appreciated
If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.
