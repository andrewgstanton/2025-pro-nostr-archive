# Canonical Numbering & Ordering Law  
## The Bitcoin Chronicles — Archivist Specification

**Author:** Andrew G. Stanton  
**Status:** Canonical Meta-Document  
**Scope:** All Chronicle narratives, past and future

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **canonical rules** governing numbering, ordering, and extensibility within *The Bitcoin Chronicles*. Its purpose is to preserve narrative integrity while allowing the canon to grow organically over time without renumbering, contradiction, or archival drift.

---

## I. Canonical Numbering Is Narrative, Not Chronological

All primary Chronicle numbers (e.g. `1.A.1`, `1.B.3`) represent **narrative sequence**, not:

- publication date  
- writing order  
- draft chronology  
- archive import order  

The number reflects **where the story belongs in the canon**, not when it was written or published.

---

## II. Canonical Numbers Are Immutable

Once a canonical number is assigned:

- it is never reused  
- it is never renumbered  
- it is never shifted  

Later discoveries, rewrites, or additions must adapt to the existing structure — **never the reverse**.

---

## III. Sections and Arcs Define Meaning

Each component has a fixed role:

- **Arc** (e.g. `1`) — a civilizational phase  
- **Section** (e.g. `A`, `B`, `C`) — a thematic domain  
- **Article number** — narrative step within that domain  

Example:

```
1.A.3 — The Exodus Protocol
```

This means:
- Arc 1
- Section A
- Third canonical narrative movement

---

## IV. Publication Cadence Is Orthogonal

Daily publishing rhythm (Free / Paid / Sabbath) is **not part of canon numbering**.

A story may be:
- written months earlier  
- published later  
- backfilled into the archive  

None of this affects its canonical position.

---

## V. Display Dates vs Canon Position

Stories may include:
- `display_date`
- `published_at`
- historical framing dates  

These are **reader-facing metadata only** and must never be used to infer canon order.

---

## VI. Interstitial Stories Are Explicitly Allowed

The canon permits **full flexibility** to add stories *between* existing canonical entries when the timeline, context, or thematic depth requires it.

Example anchors:

```
1.A.4
1.A.5

```


Stories discovered or written later that belong *between* them are valid canon.

---

## VII. Interstitial Numbering Format

Interstitial stories must follow this format:


```
<Section>.<Anchor>.0.<n> ```

Examples:


1.A.4.0.1
1.A.4.0.2
1.A.4.0.3


Where:

1.A.4 is the canonical anchor

.0 designates an interstitial layer

.n increments sequentially

```
---

## VIII. Interstitial Rules

Interstitials:

- deepen context
- explore parallel events
- introduce side figures
- add historical texture

They do not advance the primary narrative step

The main sequence always resumes unchanged at:

```
1.A.5

```

---

## IX. Interstitials Are First-Class Canon

Interstitial stories are:

- fully canonical
- indexable
- archivable
- eligible for Free or Paid status

They are not footnotes or appendices.

---


## X. No Retroactive Anchor Creation

The following are not permitted:

```
1.A.4.5
1.A.4a
1.A.4-b

```

Only the .0.n interstitial form is valid.

---

## XI. Growth Without Renumbering

This system guarantees:

- infinite extensibility
- stable citations
- archival durability
- reader clarity across generations

A reader decades from now must be able to navigate the canon without ambiguity.

# Guiding Principle

```
The canon advances in whole steps.
Understanding grows in layers.
