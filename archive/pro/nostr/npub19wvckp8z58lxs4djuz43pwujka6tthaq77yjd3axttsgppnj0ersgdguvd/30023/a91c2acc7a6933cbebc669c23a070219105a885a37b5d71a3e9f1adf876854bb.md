Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 14, 2025

Some days aren’t dramatic. They’re not disasters. They’re not breakthroughs. They’re something worse: *they’re friction.* They’re the slow grind of a hundred little obstacles that pile on each other until you feel like you’re pushing through molasses. Today was one of those days.

It began with a small discouragement — my Nextdoor post going absolutely nowhere. Zero inquiries. Zero traction. Absolutely nothing. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. Because things like this always seem to come on the days when you’re already tired, when you don’t have the margin to be brushed off by an algorithm or ignored by neighbors who are more than happy to ask for favors but never seem to return the same energy.

I don’t blame them. Everyone is busy, distracted, exhausted. But it still stung, in that small way that adds up over weeks of effort.

And then there’s Rover — the middleman you’re supposed to be grateful for, even as they slice off a chunk of the very connection *you* nurture and maintain. Rover doesn’t feed Baxter. Rover doesn’t pick up after him, or stay late, or send videos to his owner. That’s me. But somehow the platform gets a cut because it built a walled garden around other human beings and convinced everyone to stay inside.

I get why it works. People feel safer in walled gardens. But the longer I’ve lived inside them, the more suffocating they feel. Safe, yes. Comfortable, maybe. But stifling. Expensive. Limiting. And fragile in ways you only notice when something breaks.

Which brings me to YouTube.

Helping Kiyomi get her site up — kikiskitchentable.com — took hours. I was proud of it, even though it drained the last of my energy. But YouTube’s system is its own maze of invisible rules, half-working features, and contradictory constraints. You add a link in the description? Not clickable. Want it to be clickable? Add it to the “Links” section. Oh, that’s not available on shorts. Want clickable links on shorts? Too bad — you don’t get that. But maybe you can add hashtags. Or maybe the pinned comment works. Or maybe not.

It feels like building on sand.  
Every platform is sand.

By mid-afternoon I caught myself thinking:  
**Why am I fighting with these systems?**

I built Continuum so I’d never have to do this again.  
So why am I still here?

But the worst friction today wasn’t Nextdoor, Rover, or YouTube.

It was the quiet realization that the oldest Nostr events — my own posts from just six months ago — had effectively vanished from the relay landscape. Not the content, thankfully. Primal still had its backup copy. But the historical continuity? The relay provenance? The reconstructable event history?

Gone.

That’s when the friction turned into something darker. Not panic — I didn’t get emotional — but a kind of sinking heaviness. Because all the little frictions suddenly lined up and pointed to one truth:

**Walled gardens are hard because they control you.  
Sovereign systems are hard because *you* control them.**

When something breaks inside a walled garden, you can complain but you can’t fix it.  
When something breaks in your own system, you have to fix it — even if you’re tired.

And today I was so, so tired.

I wanted to walk away from the screen. I wanted one day where everything just worked — where posts got responses, where platforms behaved, where my own code didn’t surprise me. But that’s not how sovereignty works. Freedom isn’t the absence of friction. It’s the presence of responsibility.

And today, every system I touched reminded me:  
**You chose this path.  
You chose to build outside the walls.  
And this is the price.**

***

Still, there was one surprising shift today — and it didn’t come from writing code or fixing anything. It came from naming the frustration honestly.

Because once I admitted, even to myself, that everything today felt like friction, I could finally see something I’ve been ignoring: the friction is exactly what tells me I’m heading in the right direction. Walled gardens feel smooth not because they’re well-designed, but because they hide the truth.

They hide the edges.  
They hide the ownership.  
They hide the cost.  
They hide the risks.

When YouTube doesn’t give you clickable links, you don’t get to fix it.  
When Rover takes a fee, you don’t get to bypass it.  
When Nextdoor buries your posts, you don’t get to argue.  
When your oldest Nostr events disappear from relays, you don’t get to appeal to a central authority — because there isn’t one.

Decentralization gives you autonomy but exposes you to reality.  
Centralization keeps you protected but infantilizes you.

Today I felt the full weight of that exposure.

***

By evening I didn’t have a solution yet. I tried the rebroadcasting flow — it seemed logical enough — but it didn’t fix the missing events. Relays don’t magically reconstruct their pasts just because you shout the same words at them again.

Rebroadcasting, as it turns out, is not resurrection.

But even that failure carried a hint of direction. Because if rebroadcasting didn’t work, then the real solution would have to be something deeper. Something structural. Something that didn’t depend on relays or other people’s backups or the goodwill of any platform.

I didn’t know it yet, but tomorrow would give me that solution.

Tonight I’m left with the friction, the exhaustion, and the faint but honest recognition that this is what sovereignty feels like in the beginning. Heavy. Slow. Resistant. Like pushing a ship into sea water before the buoyancy kicks in.

But ships do rise.  
And tomorrow, mine will.

Tonight, though, it’s enough to admit that today was hard.  
Not because anything catastrophic happened, but because *everything* required effort.

Some days you write the code.  
Some days the code writes you.

Today, the friction wrote the story.  
Tomorrow, I begin rewriting it.
