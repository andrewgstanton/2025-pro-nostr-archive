Web3 talked a lot about freedom.\
But it didn’t ask much of me.

Participation meant showing up, clicking, co-signing, reacting.\
A few emoji could pass a vote. A few posts could signal alignment.\
But there was no real cost.\
No friction.\
No weight.

It felt easy — and eventually, it felt empty.

Bitcoin, by contrast, never asked for my attention.\
It demanded my effort.

Proof of Work isn’t just what *secures* Bitcoin.\
It’s what shapes the people who actually engage with it.

You can’t fake time.\
You can’t fake energy.\
You can’t fake commitment.

If you want to mine a block, you need to burn electricity.\
If you want to hold your keys, you need to learn what that means.\
If you want to build with Bitcoin, you’re staking *skin*, not vibes.

Eventually I realized: this isn’t just a consensus algorithm.\
It’s a *way of seeing the world*.

Proof of Work is an ethic.\
It values restraint.\
It rewards effort.\
It penalizes shortcuts.

It’s the opposite of what most of the internet has become.

***

Web3 tried to engineer consensus through incentive design — but consensus without cost is hollow.

In Bitcoin, there is no shortcut to agreement.\
You either do the work, or you don’t get a say.\
You can’t tweet your way into a block. You can’t fork your way into consensus.\
You *earn* your way — through time, electricity, and conviction.

The deeper I leaned into Bitcoin, the more it reshaped me:

* I stopped trying to “move fast” and started focusing on *lasting things*.

* I began to care more about how work was *verified*, not just how it looked.

* I started pruning systems — and relationships — that couldn’t carry weight.

Even in how I think about faith, work, rest, and community — I’ve started asking:

\> Is this real?\
\> Does this cost anything?\
\> Is this proof of *something*?

Fiat culture taught me to act like time was cheap.\
PoW culture reminded me: **time is everything**.

Fiat let me pretend I could get something for nothing.\
PoW told me the truth — *you can’t.*

***

I no longer want to participate in systems that reward shortcuts.\
I want to build slowly, honestly, and with weight.

Proof of Work isn’t just what runs Bitcoin.\
It’s what reforms me.
