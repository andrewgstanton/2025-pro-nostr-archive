To be human  
is to bear the imprint of the Creator Himself.

Not physically.  
Not biologically.  
But ontologically.

The image is not about appearance.  
It is about *being*.

To bear the image is to possess:

- the capacity to know truth  
- the authority to choose  
- the freedom to act  
- the responsibility to judge  
- the power to create  
- the dignity to love  
- the ability to shape the world  
- the call to steward creation  

Sovereignty is not an ideology.  
It is identity.

The dignity God possesses in infinite measure  
He shares with humanity  
in finite measure.

This is why tyranny is evil:  
it attempts to erase the image.

Why lies are corrosive:  
they distort the mind made to discern truth.

Why exploitation is dehumanizing:  
it treats sovereign beings as resources.

In the Chronicles universe,  
sovereignty is not a political preference  
but a **cosmic inheritance**.

Every human carries a flame  
older than the stars —  
a spark of the Creator’s own nature.

And that flame  
was never meant to remain on one world.
