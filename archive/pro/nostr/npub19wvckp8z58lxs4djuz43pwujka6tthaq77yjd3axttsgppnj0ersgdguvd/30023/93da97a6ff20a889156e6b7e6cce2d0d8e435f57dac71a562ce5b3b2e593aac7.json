  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 6, 2025\n\nIn a world addicted to speed and consumption, choosing rest is an act of defiance. It rejects the lie that human worth is measured only by output.\n\n## Fiat’s Endless Toil\n\nFiat economies encourage endless striving. Savings erode, debts mount, and people are pressured to run faster just to stay in place. “Downtime” is treated as wasted time. Even leisure is commodified into transactions and distractions.\n\nThis is not rest. It is captivity.\n\n## Rest as Sovereign Defiance\n\nSabbath rest, by contrast, is resistance. It declares: my dignity is not tied to productivity, and my worth cannot be measured in fiat. Rest is sovereignty over time.\n\nBitcoin supports this by breaking the cycle of inflationary toil. It rewards patience and preserves labor across time, making it possible to step back without losing everything.\n\n## A Community of Rest\n\nRest also creates community. When people rest together — whether families, congregations, or neighborhoods — they rediscover trust, laughter, and shared humanity. Rest heals relationships that busyness frays.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo rest is to resist. In a fiat world that enslaves through debt and consumption, Sabbath rest is an act of sovereignty — a quiet revolution of dignity.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C - ChatGPT (GPT-5), which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\n\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers, just direct proof that this work matters. It helps me keep building Continuum and writing about sovereign technology, freely and without VC overhead. Thank you.\n\nYou can send zaps to my lightning address here: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
