Andrew G. Stanton - July 1, 2025

After just a few focused weeks of building from scratch, I'm excited to release [**Continuum**](https://github.com/andrewgstanton/continuum) — a self-hosted, Bitcoin-aligned dashboard for reclaiming your digital life.

Continuum ingests and organizes your Nostr content — all **locally**, with full **Markdown editing**, **SQLite storage**, and **time zone support**. No platform lock-in. No reliance on Primal or any client.

This started as a side project. Now it’s a real working stack.

**From walled gardens to sovereign tools** — that’s the shift.

If you’re a builder, a Bitcoiner, or just tired of surrendering your content:  
This one’s for you.
