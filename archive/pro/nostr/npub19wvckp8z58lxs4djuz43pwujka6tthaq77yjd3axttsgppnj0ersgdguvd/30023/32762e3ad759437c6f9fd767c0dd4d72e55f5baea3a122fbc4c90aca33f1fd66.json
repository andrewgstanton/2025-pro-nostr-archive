      "This essay shows how vision functions in the aftermath of loss. Drawing on scriptural and historical rebuilds, it argues that vision is not escapism but disciplined sight—naming a possible future and walking toward it with rituals, budgets, and friends until it becomes visible to others."

  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 3, 2025\n\nRubble is persuasive. It insists that what is broken is the only reality there has ever been. Vision is stubborn in reply. It insists that what is not yet visible can nonetheless be named and prepared for. In this way, vision is not optimism; it is obedience to a call forward.\n\nNehemiah surveyed walls by night before announcing anything by day. He counted stones, noted gaps, listened to the city breathe. Only then did he speak a vision of rebuilding that included not just architecture but identity: *we* will be a people again. Vision names the future in plural and makes room for hands.\n\n### The Discipline of Sight\n\nAnyone can daydream. Vision is disciplined sight. It chooses constraints that force clarity. Try this: write the three sentences that describe the life you are rebuilding toward. Then list five weekly actions that make those sentences more true. The gap between the sentences and the actions is where vision either grows muscle or dies of embarrassment.\n\n### Carrying Vision With Friends\n\nLone vision corrodes into fantasy. Shared vision becomes culture. Invite two people into yours. Read the three sentences at a table. Ask them what is missing and what sounds like you. Commit to the five small actions together. Carry each other when one of you falters. This is how cities rise from rubble and families from sorrow.\n\n### Guarding Vision From Predators\n\n- **Cynicism:** pretends to be wisdom but is only fear in a nice coat.  \n- **Distraction:** sells you someone else’s vision as the price of belonging.  \n- **Haste:** forces blooms that cannot survive weather.  \n\nVision waits, attends, and does the next faithful thing.\n\n### A Closing Vision\n\n> I see a table where stories are told honestly.  \n> I see a ledger that remembers fairly.  \n> I see a street where the old greet the young by name.  \n> I see a chapel, a workshop, and a garden.  \n> I see keys in honest hands and words that do not vanish.  \n> I see tomorrow, because we carried it here.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net",
