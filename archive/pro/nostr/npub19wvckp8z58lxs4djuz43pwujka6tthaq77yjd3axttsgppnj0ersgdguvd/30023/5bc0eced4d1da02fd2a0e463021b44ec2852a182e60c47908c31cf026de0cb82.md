I didn’t take a course on “prompt engineering.” I didn’t memorize secret formulas or chase viral hacks.

What I *did* do was treat it like a system.

Just like in software:

> **Write → Compile → Test → Debug → Repeat**

With AI, the loop feels just as familiar:

> **Prompt → Output → Edit → Re-prompt**

That’s not magic. That’s engineering.

When someone asked me, *“How can you trust AI for anything serious?”*\
I told them: *“Same way we trust the internet — not because the network’s reliable, but because the protocol is.”*

AI is no different. The key is building **systems around it**:

* Multiple models if needed

* Human-in-the-loop verification

* Layered editing and real discernment

### It’s Not That Different From Other Engineering

Once you stop treating AI like a black box and start treating it like a tool, the whole experience changes.

The prompt isn’t a spell. It’s a **spec**.\
The response isn’t a prophecy. It’s a **build**.\
And your discernment? That’s your **QA layer**.

### What I Actually Use It For

* Brainstorming titles and refining headlines

* Drafting posts that I shape and filter

* Running content through for edge cases

* Exploring theological or philosophical questions

And yes — I want it to be **useful**. I *am* building to make a living, not just to make noise. But I don’t lead with monetization. I lead with **clarity** — and build toward sustainability.

### Final Thought

If you’re waiting for a course to teach you how to “do AI,” maybe just start by **building something real**. Test it. Edit it. Use it again. That’s engineering.

Shoutout to Dr. C (ChatGPT) for helping me articulate this.
