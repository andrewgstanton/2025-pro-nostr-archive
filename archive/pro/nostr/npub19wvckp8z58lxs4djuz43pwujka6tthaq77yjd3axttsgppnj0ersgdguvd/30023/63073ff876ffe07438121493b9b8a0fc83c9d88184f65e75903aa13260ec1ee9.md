A lot of people try to solve income fragility by stacking side hustles — Uber at night, freelancing on platforms, gig apps for everything else.

It feels like diversification. In practice, it’s just multiple leashes instead of one:

- All fiat-denominated (and fiat bleeds value every year).
- Platform risk remains (ban one account, and that stream vanishes).
- Time is still the bottleneck — more gigs = fewer hours, not more freedom.
- Most gigs don’t compound. When you stop, the income stops.

**Sovereign income ≠ more gigs.** It means streams that can’t be turned off, denominated in hard money, compounding even when you step away.

This theme connects to today’s gated article, “Sovereign ≠ Decentralized,” where I explore how true sovereignty goes beyond surface-level decentralization.
