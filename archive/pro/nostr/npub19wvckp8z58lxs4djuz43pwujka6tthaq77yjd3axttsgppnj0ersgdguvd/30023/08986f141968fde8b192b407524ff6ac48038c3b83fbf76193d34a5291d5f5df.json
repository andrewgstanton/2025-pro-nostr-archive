Stanton - June 27, 2025\n\n# 🏗️ From Walled Gardens to Sovereign Stacks  \n## Why We’re Building in Public — with Bitcoin and Nostr\n\n---\n\n### 🌱 The Problem\n\nNearly every SaaS product today is a walled garden.\n\nYou don’t own your data.  \nYou rent access to your own work.  \nYour account can be locked, priced out, or shadowbanned without notice.  \n\nFeatures change. Policies change. You don’t get a vote.\n\nEven the well-intentioned platforms eventually turn inward — optimizing for growth, not freedom.  \nWhat started as “software as a service” became **software as a cage**.\n\n---\n\n### 🪓 The Breakaway\n\nWe’re not trying to “disrupt SaaS.”  \nWe’re doing something more radical:\n\nWe’re **opting out**.\n\nInstead of building closed platforms, we’re building **sovereign stacks**:\n\n🔓 Open by design  \n⚡ Powered by Bitcoin  \n📡 Federated through Nostr  \n💻 Local-first, cloud-optional\n\nEvery tool we build works without us.  \nHosting is offered as a **convenience — not a dependency**.\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 What We’re Building\n\nUnder Golden Gate Group, we’re developing tools for real-world sovereignty:\n\n| Tool           | Replaces                     | Sovereign Stack Description                          |\n|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **MyContinuum**| LinkedIn, Medium, Notion     | Identity + publishing over Nostr                     |\n| **GetMorty**   | Title companies, notaries     | Property title lookup + validation                   |\n| **GGG MLS**    | Zillow, Realtor.com           | Bitcoin-aligned property listings                    |\n| **Signal Tools**| Hootsuite, Substack         | Local-first zapping + cross-posting                  |\n| **Nostr Blog** | Ghost, Substack              | Static sovereign longform blog                       |\n\nThese aren’t just products.  \nThey’re **protocol-native tools that respect your freedom**.\n\nYou can:  \n✅ Run them locally  \n✅ Host them yourself  \n✅ Clone, remix, or extend them freely  \n✅ Or subscribe to hosted versions — no lock-in, ever\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 Bonus Note for Builders\n\nThe most mind-bending realization of all:  \nWith Nostr, you don’t need to store or manage anything permanently.\n\nEvery piece of data — every post, listing, article, or profile — is already out there.\n\nYou’re not building a database.  \n**You’re building a lens.**\n\nApps aren’t platforms anymore — they’re filters, viewers, and interpreters.\n\n- **Identity?** Already baked in.  \n- **Monetization?** Already native (zaps).  \n- **Social graph?** Embedded in the protocol.\n\nThe old SaaS model says:  \n> “Store the user’s data and rent it back to them.”\n\nThe sovereign model says:  \n> “Let users own their data — and build tools that honor that.”\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 Rebuilding the SaaS Stack with Nostr\n\n| SaaS Platform     | Nostr Equivalent                     | Notes                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Facebook**     | Notes (kind `1`), DMs (kind `4`)     | Social graph, posts, and groups can be replicated     |\n| **Substack**     | Articles (kind `30023`)              | Long-form posts with zaps + open comments             |\n| **Twitter/X**    | Notes (kind `1`)                     | Microblogging + reply threading                       |\n| **Discord**      | Encrypted DMs (kind `4`), Channels   | Room-based chats via relay filters or tagging         |\n| **Medium**       | Articles (kind `30023`)              | Write once, mirror forever across relays              |\n| **Craigslist**   | Classifieds (custom kind or tags)    | Listings, with replies and zaps for contact/payment   |\n| **Patreon**      | Zaps + tag-based gating              | Supporters-only content via tags + relay filters      |\n| **Notion**       | Structured notes, metadata tags      | Public knowledge garden, outline-based navigation     |\n| **GitHub Gists** | Notes with `code:` tags or custom UI | Lightweight snippet sharing, versionable              |\n| **Shopify**      | Product/event listings + paywalls    | BTC/Nostr-native commerce stack (via Zaprite/lnbits)  |\n\nYou don’t need to mimic their UI or business model.  \nYou just need to ask: **What core interaction is happening here?**\n\nIf it’s:\n- A message → `kind 1` or `kind 4`  \n- A document → `kind 30023`  \n- A listing → tagged event  \n- A payment → zap  \n\nThen it can be rebuilt — **sovereign, portable, and open**.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Platform Archive Integration (Coming Soon to MyContinuum)\n\nWe’re also working to integrate full data archives from legacy platforms — so you can take back your digital history.\n\n| Platform     | Archive Format | Parsed Content                   | Potential Features                          |\n|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **LinkedIn** | JSON/CSV       | Posts, messages, connections     | Resume generation, post-to-Nostr, graphing  |\n| **Facebook** | JSON/HTML      | Timeline posts, DMs, groups      | Memory timeline, convert to blog, tagging   |\n| **X/Twitter**| JSON           | Tweets, threads, DMs, likes      | Thread-to-article, sentiment map, mirror    |\n| **Instagram**| JSON           | Captions, media, stories         | Personal photo blog, media indexing         |\n| **YouTube**  | JSON/CSV       | Video uploads, comments, subs    | Creator archive, searchable transcript DB   |\n| **Nostr**    | JSON (native)  | Notes, articles, metadata        | Already integrated — sovereign by design    |\n\nYour posts, messages, and moments belong to **you**.  \nWith MyContinuum, they’ll stay that way.\n\n---\n\n### 🛤️ The Philosophy\n\nOwn your identity.  \nOwn your content.  \nOwn your value.\n\nNo paywalls for basic access.  \nNo tricks, no traps, no friction added just to extract revenue.  \nOnly tools that work — honestly and transparently.\n\nBecause the future isn’t just decentralized.  \nIt’s **sovereign**.\n\nAnd it’s already here — if you’re willing to build it.\n\n---\n\n✍️ **Andrew G. Stanton**  \nFounder, Golden Gate Group  \nCTO, MyContinuum  \nBitcoin believer. Sovereignty builder.\n\n🌀 *This article was published through my self-hosted instance of MyContinuum — because sovereignty begins with owning your own voice.*",
