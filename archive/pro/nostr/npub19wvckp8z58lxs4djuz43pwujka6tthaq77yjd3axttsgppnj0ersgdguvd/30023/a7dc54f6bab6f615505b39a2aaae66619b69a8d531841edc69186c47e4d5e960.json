  "content": "## **How I Built a Decentralized CMS with Nostr + GitHub Actions**\n\n🧡 *My first post on a fully sovereign blog.*\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis blog post isn’t hosted on Medium, Substack, or WordPress.\\\nIt doesn’t live on a database I don’t control.\\\nThere’s no login, no admin panel, no SaaS dashboard.\n\nInstead, this post was published as a Nostr event —\\\nstored on dozens of relays,\\\nfetched with open-source scripts,\\\nrendered as a static HTML file,\\\nand served globally via GitHub Pages.\n\nAnd it all runs without a single server I have to manage.\n\nLet me show you how it works — and why this matters.\n\n***\n\n### Step 1: Writing on Nostr\n\nI use [Primal.net](https://primal.net) to write my articles.\\\nTheir long-form editor lets you add titles, summaries, and tags to a special kind of Nostr event (`30023`).\\\nYou just click publish — and the article propagates across the Nostr network.\n\n### Step 2: Fetching Events\n\nOn my GitHub repo, I maintain a script called `fetch_articles.py`.\\\nIt connects to multiple Nostr relays (like `relay.damus.io`, `relay.primal.net`, `nostr.mom`, etc.) and fetches any articles I've written using my public key.\\\nOnly posts tagged with `blog` or `article` are kept.\n\nEach article is:\n\n* Deduplicated\n\n* Parsed for title, summary, image, tags, and content\n\n* Converted from Markdown to clean HTML\n\n* Saved in a static folder\n\n### Step 3: Hosting with GitHub Pages\n\nThe output goes straight into the `docs/` folder of my public GitHub repository.\\\nThanks to GitHub Pages, the site is instantly deployed as a static website.\n\nThe homepage (`index.html`) uses JavaScript to read `articles/index.json` and display the 10 most recent blog posts — each linking to its full static HTML page.\n\n### Step 4: Fully Automated via GitHub Actions\n\nTo keep things fresh, I created a GitHub Action called `Fetch and Build Articles`.\\\nIt runs daily — or whenever I trigger it manually — and fetches new content from Nostr, updates the site, and redeploys everything.\n\nNo databases.\\\nNo plugins.\\\nNo backend headaches.\\\nJust content — and the open protocols that carry it.\n\n***\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nMost blogs are brittle.\\\nLose your password, your server, or your platform — and your voice disappears.\n\nThis setup flips that on its head:\n\n* **I own my content** — It's stored on a public, censorship-resistant network.\n\n* **Anyone can verify it** — The data lives on Nostr relays, signed with my pubkey.\n\n* **It costs nothing to host** — GitHub Pages serves everything statically.\n\n* **It’s future-proof** — If GitHub disappeared, I could mirror the repo anywhere.\n\nThis is what publishing *should* look like in 2025.\n\n***\n\n### Want to Build Your Own?\n\nYou can fork the repo I use [here](https://github.com/andrewgstanton/blog-stantonweb-site) —\\\nor read the code and set it up for your own Nostr pubkey.\n\nIf you’re not on Nostr yet, you can find me at:\\\n🧬 `npub19wvckp8z58lxs4djuz43pwujka6tthaq77yjd3axttsgppnj0ersgdguvd`\n\nThis is just the beginning.\\\nOne post, one block, one step at a time —\\\non our own terms.\n",
