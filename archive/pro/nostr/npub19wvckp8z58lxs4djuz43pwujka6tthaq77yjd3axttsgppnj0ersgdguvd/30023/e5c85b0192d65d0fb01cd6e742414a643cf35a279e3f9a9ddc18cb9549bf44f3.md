Jesus spoke in parables --- ordinary stories that revealed extraordinary
truths. A seed, a coin, a treasure hidden in a field.

Bitcoin is not the Kingdom of God. But it is a parable. A story written
in code and history, pointing to truth, value, sacrifice, and
incorruptibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Treasure Hidden in a Field

In 2010, 10,000 bitcoins bought two pizzas. At the time, it looked
trivial. Yet that trade marked the first moment incorruptible money
entered the marketplace.

Bitcoin was like treasure buried in plain sight. The world ignored it.
But those with eyes to see gave up much to claim it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Mustard Seed

It began small: a whitepaper on a mailing list, obscure forums, no press
coverage. Yet the seed grew --- quietly, steadily, unstoppably.

What looked weak became a shelter for millions: Venezuelans escaping
hyperinflation, Nigerians bypassing broken banks, ordinary people
reclaiming sovereignty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Cost of Truth

Truth always carries a cost. Forgiveness is free to the forgiven, but
costly to the forgiver.

Bitcoin runs on proof-of-work --- costly, unforgeable, rooted in
reality. No free ride. No counterfeit. No decree that can bypass it.

The Cross was the ultimate proof of work. Bitcoin mirrors the principle
in miniature: freedom requires cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Coins Left Untouched

Satoshi mined about a million bitcoins. Enough to make him the
wealthiest person alive. Yet those coins have never moved.

Perhaps he died. Perhaps he walked away. Either way, the untouched
fortune itself is a parable: treasure surrendered so the system could
remain incorruptible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unforkable Truth

Altcoins have tried to copy Bitcoin. Some promise faster, smarter,
greener. All fail.

Because you can fork code, but not history. You can copy software, but
not incorruptibility.

Bitcoin is the printing press --- a civilizational breakthrough.
Altcoins are carnival tickets and junk mail. They may amuse, but they
are not the revolution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Altcoins as Test Nets

And yet, even failed experiments serve a purpose. Altcoins are test nets
with economic skin in the game. They reveal human behavior, test fragile
ideas, and --- mostly --- prove why Bitcoin's design endures.

Their collapse strengthens the parable. Every failure points back to the
one foundation that holds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Paradox of Late Conviction

I wish I had this clarity in 2016. Bitcoin was under \$1,000. The noise
of altcoins was deafening.

But here is the paradox: early wealth without understanding is fragile.
Late conviction with understanding is unshakable.

Early entry builds fortune. Late conviction builds endurance. And
Bitcoin is about enduring truth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bitcoin as Providence

Its timing is uncanny: released after the 2008 crash exposed fiat's
rot.\
Its founder: anonymous, immune to bribes, untouchable by power.\
Its design: incorruptible, unfakeable, unforkable.

Coincidence? Or providence? Like the printing press before the
Reformation, Bitcoin arrived as if seeded into history exactly when the
world needed it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conclusion: The Parable Lives

Parables take ordinary things --- seeds, coins, treasure --- and reveal
eternal truths.

Bitcoin, too, is a parable: of treasure hidden until revealed, of
freedom that requires cost, of incorruptible truth that endures beyond
its giver.

It is not the gospel. But it is a signpost toward the gospel, for those
with ears to hear.

Bitcoin is the parable of truth in a world of lies. And the parable is
still being told.
