  "content": "Most of the assets I hold—real estate, equities, and businesses—depreciate in value over time. Some literally, like physical buildings and equipment. Some functionally, like tech platforms that age faster than they grow. Even cash, which should feel \"safe,\" quietly loses ground to inflation. Yet I continue to build. I continue to hold. And I continue to believe that what I’m doing matters.\n\nBut underneath all of that — beneath the mortgages, margin trades, and business pivots — I’ve made a long-term bet:\n\n**Bitcoin will outlast the decay.**\n\n***\n\n### The Decaying System I Still Operate In\n\nLet me be clear: I’m not a Bitcoin purist. I use debt. I borrow to acquire real estate. I trade with margin in a brokerage account. I understand leverage — not as a sin, but as a tool that must be used with precision and respect. But I’m also not naive.\n\nThe entire fiat-based financial system is built on a slow erosion of value. Inflation isn't a bug — it’s a feature. And it's why most business models, whether in real estate or retail, implicitly rely on **asset inflation just to stay solvent**.\n\nThat’s not sustainable. And it’s not honest.\n\n***\n\n### The Bitcoin Thesis: Deflation That Works for You\n\nBitcoin is fundamentally different. Its supply is fixed. Its issuance is decreasing. Over time, as adoption grows and fiat weakens, **Bitcoin’s purchasing power increases**.\n\nThat changes the game.\n\nIf you can hold even a small portion of your balance sheet in BTC — not just as an investment, but as a **strategic hedge** — it becomes a way to *offset the natural depreciation* of your other holdings. Your buildings may age. Your cash flow may fluctuate. But your Bitcoin, if properly secured and held with conviction, becomes the **anchor**.\n\nIt’s not about day trading BTC or catching the next ATH. It’s about understanding that in a world designed to leak value, **Bitcoin lets you patch the hole.**\n\n***\n\n### Why This Matters for Builders\n\nIf you run a business — especially one with real assets, recurring costs, or thin margins — you know how brutal depreciation can be. Taxes, maintenance, inflation, replacement cycles… it never stops.\n\nAdding BTC to your long-term treasury isn’t about becoming a \"crypto company.\" It’s about becoming **anti-fragile.** It’s about building with a component that doesn’t rot.\n\nIn 5, 10, or 20 years, I may still be paying off mortgages and navigating property cycles. But if my Bitcoin allocation is still intact, still growing in real purchasing power… then I haven’t just preserved wealth. I’ve preserved *optionality*. I’ve created a counterbalance to the relentless decay of everything else.\n\n***\n\n### Final Word\n\nI still play the fiat game — because for now, I have to. But I’m no longer betting everything on it. Bitcoin is my base layer now. Quiet, cold-stored, and uncompromising.\n\nIt offsets depreciation — not just financially, but philosophically. It reminds me that *not everything has to erode*. Not everything has to be sacrificed to time or policy or inflation.\n\nSome things can actually hold. Some things can last.\n\nAnd if I build right — maybe what I build can last too.\n\n***\n\nIf this resonated, feel free to send a zap — it helps me keep writing and building from a place of conviction.\n\nThis article was co-written with the help of ChatGPT, a tool I use to refine and clarify what I’m working through in real time.\n",
