## From Idea to Infrastructure — A Sovereign Stack Emerges

**May 24, 2025** — I made my first commit to what would become *Continuum*.  
Just a simple README. No code yet. But the vision was forming.

**Early June** — The codebase began to take shape. A local-first app built on Nostr.  
No logins. No passwords. Just sovereign identity, Bitcoin principles, and a refusal to rent space in someone else’s walled garden.

**July 1** — Version 1.0.0 launched.  
Not a prototype. Not a pitch deck.  
A real, working app that could:
- Load identities
- Sign and publish Nostr events
- Store your data — locally, and on relays you choose

## 🚀 In 60 Days, We’ve Built

- **Local-first Nostr identity management**  
  → No need to trust a browser extension or third-party wallet

- **Publishing tools for notes, articles, and profiles**  
  → With markdown support and NIP-05/NIP-07 integration

- **Multi-identity support**  
  → One user, many personas — each sovereign, each with its own `npub`

- **Hosted mirror dashboards**  
  → Read-only Continuum Pro views at `dashboard.mycontinuum.xyz/npub`

- **LinkedIn ZIP import**  
  → Turn a corporate resume into a sovereign profile, no OAuth needed

## 🟠 Why It Matters

This isn’t a Twitter clone. It’s not a new social app.  
**Continuum is a sovereign publishing and identity framework.**  
It lets you:
- Own your data  
- Sign your voice  
- Publish without asking permission

It’s not about hype. It’s about freedom.

## 🙋‍♂️ What’s Next

- Add images, videos, and richer media to sovereign posts  
- Build dashboards that mirror (and eventually edit) profiles like LinkedIn or GitHub  
- Enable selective sharing, zaps-for-access, and sovereign service metadata

But for now — what we’ve already built works.  
I don’t need to log into Primal to publish an article.  
I don’t need anyone’s approval to create a new identity.  
I can run Continuum locally.  
I can push to the world.

And that’s enough to keep going.
