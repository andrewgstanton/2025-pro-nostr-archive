  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 3, 2025\n\nThe modern world loves to brand virtue.  \nFaith, justice, sustainability, purpose — all turned into hashtags and conferences. The words glow with sincerity, but their power fades with every repetition. When belief becomes a slogan, it stops being a guide and starts being a product.\n\nJesus warned about this long before marketing existed:  \n\n> “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.”  \n> *(Matthew 6:1)*  \n\nand again,  \n\n> “Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret.”  \n> *(Matthew 6:3-4)*  \n\nThe tragedy isn’t that these people are insincere. It’s that they’ve confused visibility with authenticity. In an attention economy, the loudest conviction wins, not the truest one. You can monetize almost any virtue if you say it often enough.\n\nThat’s how “faith-driven innovation” turned into a cottage industry: the language of devotion wrapped around the mechanics of marketing. Panels, logos, partnerships — all the trappings of mission, without the cost of obedience. It’s not evil; it’s hollow.\n\nThe early church didn’t need branding because it had witness.  The fruit was visible in how people lived, not how they advertised.  As Paul wrote,  \n\n> “Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good.”  \n> *(Romans 12:9)*  \n\nThe same principle still applies: *truth doesn’t require promotion — only proof.*\n\nFaith that never risks embarrassment, never breaks with comfort, never names the idol, becomes just another brand of compromise.  \nIt’s safe, profitable, and utterly forgettable.\n\nThe cure isn’t cynicism; it’s integrity.  \nKeep your faith too sacred to sell. Let your work speak plainly.  When people sense that your words and your actions occupy the same space, the message carries its own gravity.\n\nSlogans fade.  \nSubstance abides.  \nAnd faith that keeps its silence until there’s something worth saying will outlast the noise.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
