Stanton - August 23, 2025\n\nWe have traced the tension between “all” and “eternal.” We saw that “all” means every person without exception, and that “eternal” (aionios) does not always mean endless duration. The question remains: what then is the purpose of judgment? If it is not unending torment, what role does it play in God’s victorious plan?\n\n## Judgment in the Biblical Story\n\nFrom Genesis to Revelation, judgment is real. Fire falls. Nations are overthrown. Exiles are endured. God’s wrath is not metaphorical but actual. Yet what we often miss is the trajectory of these judgments: they are never the end of the story.\n\n- **The Flood**: Humanity is judged, yet Noah’s family is preserved, and creation is renewed.\n- **Exile**: Israel is sent into Babylon, yet always with a promise of return.\n- **Prophetic oracles**: Nations are warned, punished, but also promised restoration (see Isaiah 19: Egypt and Assyria blessed with Israel).\n\nJudgment in Scripture is severe, but its end is restoration.\n\n## The Refining Fire\n\nPaul captures this imagery most directly:\n\n“Each one’s work will be revealed by fire; the fire will test what sort of work each has done… If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.” (1 Cor 3:13,15)\n\nHere judgment is not annihilation nor eternal torment. It is purification. What cannot last is burned away; what is true endures. The person is saved, but through fire.\n\nThis theme recurs throughout Scripture:\n\n- Malachi speaks of God as a “refiner’s fire.”\n- Zechariah pictures a third of the people passing through fire and being refined like silver.\n- Hebrews reminds us, “Our God is a consuming fire.”\n\nThe fire is destructive, yes — but destructive of dross, not of the person made in God’s image.\n\n## Wrath as Cleansing, Not Abandonment\n\nWhen Paul writes of “wrath,” he often uses present-tense language (Rom 1:18). Wrath is what happens when we give ourselves to corruption; it is God handing us over to our choices. Yet even here the goal is not abandonment but healing.\n\nConsider discipline:\n\n- “The Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastens everyone he accepts as his son.” (Heb 12:6)\n- Judgment without restoration would be punishment without purpose — something alien to the character of God.\n\nIf God is love, then even His wrath must ultimately serve the purposes of love.\n\n## The Paradox of “Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth”\n\nWhat then of Jesus’ warnings about outer darkness, fire, and gnashing teeth? These images describe the experience of judgment. Letting go of sin, idols, pride, and the self-will we cling to is painful. Dying to the old self hurts. That pain is real — but it is not endless. It is the pain of purification, not the sentence of eternal futility.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nIf judgment is endless, then evil has the last word. Countless souls would remain forever in rebellion, unhealed, unredeemed. God’s victory would be partial, His image forever marred. But if judgment is purifying, then even the fiercest fire serves a greater end: the reconciliation of all things.\n\nThis does not trivialize judgment. It makes it more profound. God’s justice is not satisfied by perpetual suffering. It is satisfied when the sinner is cleansed, when the wounds of evil are burned away, and when the person is restored to life.\n\n## The Cross as the Pattern\n\nThe cross itself embodies this truth. Jesus bore judgment, wrath, and death. Yet that was not the end — resurrection followed. If the Son of God underwent judgment unto renewal, then the same pattern will be true for humanity as a whole: death → fire → life.\n\nJudgment, then, is not the triumph of sin. It is the furnace through which God brings about the triumph of grace.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo proclaim God’s judgment as purifying is not to deny its severity. It is to place it within the larger story of God’s love. The fire is real, the pain is real, the weeping is real. But these are not the final word. Judgment serves reconciliation. Wrath bends to mercy. The end of the story is not eternal defeat, but the victory of God being “all in all.”",
