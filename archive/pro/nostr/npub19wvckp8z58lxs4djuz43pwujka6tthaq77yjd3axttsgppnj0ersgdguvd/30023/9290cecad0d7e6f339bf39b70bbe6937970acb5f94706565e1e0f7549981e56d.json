  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 26, 2025\n\nWhen I think about living on the Moon, I’m caught between awe and unease.  \nAwe — because the idea of walking beneath a black sky dusted with stars, setting up domes and greenhouses and calling them home, feels like stepping into the story of Genesis itself.  \nUnease — because every attempt to possess what God has made seems to echo the first temptation: you will be like God.  \n\nThe Scriptures say plainly: “The earth is the Lord’s, and all it contains; the world, and those who dwell in it.” (Psalm 24:1)  \nIf that’s true of Earth, then it must be true of the Moon, too — and of Mars, and every grain of dust circling the Sun.  \nWe can map them, name them, even touch them, but they will never be ours.  \nThey were spoken into being before any human hand reached out to grasp them.  \n\nAnd yet, we are told to go — to multiply, to fill the earth, to cultivate and to keep it.  \nIs it disobedience to extend that calling outward?  \nOr is exploration itself part of stewardship — an unfolding of creation rather than a conquest of it?  \n\nI wrestle with this tension constantly.  \nOn one hand, I’m a builder: I want to design systems, habitats, and protocols that can sustain life off-world.  \nI want to see humanity break free from the fragility of one planet.  \nBut on the other hand, I know that every claim of ownership — every “mine” or “ours” — sits uneasily against the truth that we are tenants, not landlords, in God’s universe.  \n\nMaybe that’s why Scripture begins with both creation and rest.  \nSix days of making, one of letting go.  \nIt’s as if God built the rhythm of stewardship into time itself: build, but then release.  \nWork, but remember who it all belongs to.  \nWithout Sabbath, even our best building becomes idolatry.  \n\nI imagine a future lunar base built around that rhythm.  \nA place where technology hums quietly in service to life — oxygen from regolith, water drawn from frozen craters, gardens growing in sealed domes — yet the people pause each seventh day to acknowledge that none of it is theirs.  \nThey might look out at the distant blue glow of Earth and read Psalm 8 aloud:  \n“When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,  \nthe moon and the stars, which you have set in place —  \nwhat is mankind that you are mindful of them?”  \n\nThat question could anchor the first lunar Sabbath.  \nIt’s not a denial of our agency, but a remembering of our place.  \n\nI sometimes wonder if the divine plan includes these frontier longings — the urge to cross seas, to climb mountains, to reach for the stars.  \nMaybe it does.  \nMaybe humanity’s restless creativity is part of the image of God in us: not to own, but to reflect.  \nTo echo the act of creation without replacing the Creator.  \nTo extend order into chaos, life into emptiness, beauty into void.  \n\nBut the risk remains: without humility, we turn every frontier into another Babylon — towers built in our name, not His.  \nThe history of Earth is littered with those ruins.  \nWhat would keep the Moon from becoming one more?  \n\nPerhaps it’s the same principle that underlies Bitcoin, and sovereignty, and the work I’m doing through Continuum:  \nownership re-imagined as responsibility, not dominion.  \nA distributed stewardship, where no single power can claim the whole, but everyone is accountable for the part they hold.  \nMaybe that’s how we should approach the heavens — not as landlords, but as co-signers on a cosmic lease written by grace.  \n\nStill, I struggle with it.  \nI look at the stars and feel the pull of ambition.  \nI want to build something that lasts — something that proves we were here, that our work mattered.  \nBut perhaps the truest legacy is not permanence, but participation: joining God’s creative rhythm, then laying it down.  \nEven the most advanced habitat will one day decay; the question is whether its builders will have learned reverence in the process.  \n\nThe heavens belong to God.  \nBut maybe, in His mercy, He lets us borrow them for a while — to learn what ownership really means.  \nTo discover that freedom is not in possession, but in trust.  \nThat the universe is not ours to claim, but ours to care for.  \n\nWhen I return to that thought, the unease softens.  \nI still want to build — but I want to build rightly.  \nTo treat every circuit, every dome, every byte of data as sacred material.  \nTo design systems that honor the Creator by their integrity, resilience, and grace.  \n\nMaybe that’s the true calling of this age of exploration:  \nnot conquering space, but consecrating it.  \nNot claiming new worlds, but revealing what was already holy.  \n\nAnd if someday humans live on the Moon —  \nif we carve homes in lava tubes or print domes from dust —  \nI hope the first plaque we leave behind doesn’t read “Property of Earth”,  \nbut something closer to “The Lord’s and not ours.”  \n\nThat would be a fitting beginning for any world.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
