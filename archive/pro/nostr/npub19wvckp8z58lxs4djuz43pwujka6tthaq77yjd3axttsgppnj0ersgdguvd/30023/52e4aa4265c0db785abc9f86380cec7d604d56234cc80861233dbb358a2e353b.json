      "A personal reflection on turning 60—looking back at a decade of transformation from dismissing Bitcoin as “tech for tech’s sake” to embracing it as a framework for truth, alignment, and intentional living. The post traces a journey of pruning, repentance, and recommitment to building a life rooted in faith, purpose, and conviction. It speaks to those in transition, encouraging them that the second half of life can be the truest chapter yet."

  "content": "**Turning 60**\n\nTen years ago, I turned 50 with a vague sense that something was off.\n\nI was building things, but they didn’t feel grounded.\\\nI was \"in tech,\" but tech felt like a treadmill—just faster, sleeker tools chasing the same hollow outcomes.\\\nI knew about Bitcoin, but I dismissed it. I thought it was just “tech for tech’s sake.”\n\nLess than a year later, I fell down the rabbit hole.\n\nIt didn’t happen all at once. At first it was curiosity. Then dissonance. Then conviction.\n\nSomewhere in that process, I realized Bitcoin wasn’t just financial—it was philosophical. It was moral. It was *real*. And it held up a mirror to a life I had built on momentum more than mission.\n\nSo I started pruning.\n\nI left Web3.\\\nI pulled back from projects that ran on hype instead of honesty.\\\nI repented—for chasing relevance instead of righteousness.\\\nAnd I began stacking—not just sats, but new habits. New thinking. New rhythms of faith, work, and rest.\n\nNow at 60, I’m not where I thought I’d be.\n\nBut I’m more myself than I’ve ever been.\\\nMore convicted.\\\nMore rooted.\\\nMore ready.\n\nNot to start over—but to *build again*, from the foundation up.\n\n***\n\nIf you're in that middle place—between chapters, between convictions, between certainty and surrender—you're not alone.\n\n🟠 I’m still here. Still building. Still listening.\n\nZap if this resonates, or send your story. I’d love to hear it.\n\n\\[[*Zap *](https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t)*]\\(*[*https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t*](https://tinyurl.com/yuyu2b9t)*)*\n\n***\n",
