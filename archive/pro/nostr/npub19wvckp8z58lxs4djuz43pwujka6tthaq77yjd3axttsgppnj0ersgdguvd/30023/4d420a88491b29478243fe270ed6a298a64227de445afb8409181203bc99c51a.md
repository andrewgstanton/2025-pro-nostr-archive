## Bitcoin: Property, Not a Security — Why It Matters

**Michael Saylor’s key point:** Bitcoin is **property** (like gold, real estate, cash). Most altcoins, tokens, and NFTs are **securities** under the Howey Test. The crypto industry blurs this line to ride Bitcoin’s credibility without earning it.

### Property vs. Security vs. Commodity — At a Glance

| Category      | Definition | Examples | Key Risks | Regulatory Body |
|---------------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Property**  | Something you own outright, no dependency on third parties. | Real estate, gold, cash | Theft, loss, natural depreciation | Property law |
| **Commodity** | Fungible property not dependent on an issuer. | Oil, wheat, gold, **Bitcoin** | Market volatility, storage | CFTC (U.S.) |
| **Security**  | Investment in a common enterprise with profit from others’ efforts. | Stocks, bonds, ICO tokens, most altcoins, NFTs | Issuer failure, fraud, dilution | SEC (U.S.) |

### Case Study: Evergreen Coin (EGC) (evergreencoin.org)

- Marketed as “green crypto” with ~7% staking yield (in EGC) and monthly rewards for “proof of environment” projects.  
- **Price collapse:** $0.05 → $0.0008 (−98%+).  
- Rewards often $1–$2/month, hard to sell or convert.  
- One supporter even **subsidized payouts in USD** via World Remit when holdings exceeded ~$20 — without this, rewards were functionally worthless.  
- Founder trademarked “Proof of Environment(tm) ” and tied it to the EGC token, limiting openness.  
- While there’s no evidence of malicious intent, the model was fundamentally flawed. A better path would be to release the trademark and reward in sats — but this is unlikely to happen.

**Lesson:**  
- Good idea → Reward environmental projects with open, hard money (sats).  
- Bad execution → Illiquid token, centralized branding, blurred charity/investment lines.  
- Being “too small to prosecute” is not proof of soundness — it’s just why regulators ignore it.

**Note:** Because “Proof of Environment(tm)” is trademarked, others cannot use the exact term for a sats-based, open implementation without permission. While nothing stops someone from rewarding environmental projects in sats under a different name, locking the phrase runs counter to the open ethos that allows good ideas to spread freely.

### Why This Is Urgent

- **Legal:** Promoting unregistered securities is a compliance and ethical hazard.  
- **Practical:** Bitcoin’s classification as digital commodity property gives it global portability, no counterparty risk, and clear tax treatment.  
- **Ethical:** Pretending altcoins are “just like Bitcoin” misleads communities and damages trust.

**Bottom Line:**  
Bitcoin is **digital commodity property** — incorruptible, borderless, and not dependent on any issuer.  
Most other crypto assets are speculative securities dressed up as decentralized innovation.
