# The Cost of Compromise: Bitcoin vs. Web3

*By Andrew G. Stanton*

## Introduction: All Systems Are Not Created Equal

In the past several years, I’ve experienced both the promise and the pain of working inside emerging technologies. Like many others, I was drawn into the world of “Web3,” hoping it would deliver on ideals like decentralization, freedom, and innovation.

But after countless hours, dollars, and conversations, I’ve come to a stark realization:

> Not all protocols are neutral. Not all losses are personal mistakes.  
> Some are structural. Some are spiritual.

There is a fundamental difference between building on **Bitcoin** and building on **Web3/NFT systems** — and it’s not just technical. It’s ethical. It’s economic. It’s theological.

## Why Bitcoin Is Different

Bitcoin isn’t perfect. It’s not “God’s money.” But its architecture reflects **biblical values** and **moral clarity** in ways no other digital system does:

- **Fixed supply** — no insider inflation  
- **Open access** — no privileged actors  
- **Immutable history** — no rewriting the ledger  
- **No premines, no backdoors, no yield traps**

Bitcoin assumes that **humans are fallible**, and it builds accordingly. Trust is minimized, verification is enforced, and no one is above the rules — not the devs, not the early adopters, not the institutions.

And that’s why its **protocol-level loss rate** remains near zero.

## The Web3 Reality: A System Built to Fail

In contrast, Web3 — for all its innovation — has proven to be a **structural trap** for capital, trust, and time. It is an ecosystem designed to reward:

- Early insiders and privileged allocations  
- Speculation over stewardship  
- Governance by social influence  
- Yield divorced from productivity  
- Hype over truth

These aren’t bugs. They’re features.  
And they have cost billions — not just in value, but in **credibility and witness**.

## My Personal Ledger: Losses by System

>  Note: These are estimates only — not an exact financial accounting. Most of these losses reflect wasted time, misaligned energy, and systemic distractions rather than direct capital losses.

> In fact, I made approximately $10,000 in realized gains trading altcoins during certain periods. But looking back, the opportunity cost — in clarity, conviction, and direction — far outweighed those short-term wins.

Here is a personal comparison of how my capital and time fared in Bitcoin vs. Web3 environments:

| Category                                      | Bitcoin Impact (USD) | Web3/NFT Impact (USD) |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Protocol flaws / inflation bugs              | $0                    | $15,000               |
| Governance-based losses                      | $0                    | $8,000                |
| Rug pulls / insider trading losses           | $0                    | $25,000               |
| Deplatforming / access issues                | $0                    | $2,000                |
| Staking collapses / yield model failures     | $0                    | $18,000               |
| Time wasted on unstable ecosystems           | $5,000                | $10,000               |
| Emotional burnout from hype cycles           | $2,000                | $5,000                |
| Chasing shifting narratives (alts, L2s, etc) | $3,000                | $12,000               |
| **TOTAL**                                    | **$10,000**           | **$95,000**           |

> Bitcoin’s losses were emotional or opportunity-based.  
> Web3’s losses were **systemic and avoidable — by design.**

## The Global Ledger: A Structural Failure

It’s not just me. These are the global losses from major Web3 ecosystem failures:

| Event / Category                                      | Estimated Loss (USD, Billions) |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Terra/LUNA + Anchor + UST collapse                   | $40.0B                          |
| FTX exchange collapse                                | $8.0B                           |
| Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi bankruptcies               | $5.0B                           |
| Ronin Bridge hack (Axie Infinity)                    | $0.6B                           |
| Wormhole exploit (Solana ↔ Ethereum bridge)          | $0.3B                           |
| Alt-L1 rug pulls & NFT wash trading                  | $3.5B                           |
| DAO governance abuse / treasury exploits             | $0.5B                           |
| Yield ponzis (Wonderland, OlympusDAO, etc.)          | $1.5B                           |
| **TOTAL**                                            | **$59.4B**                      |

None of these are one-off accidents.  
They are the **natural result** of systems that empower human manipulation and reward trust over truth.

## Why I Built Continuum

This is why I’m building **Continuum** — not on Bitcoin directly, but on **Nostr**, a protocol that applies Bitcoin’s core principles to **identity** and **publishing**.

Continuum is about giving people the ability to:
- Own their identity  
- Own their voice  
- Own their network  
- Without relying on platforms, tokens, or trusted middlemen

We are not trying to tokenize identity. We are not staking attention.  
We are building on rock — not sand.

## Final Word: An Appeal, Not an Attack

To those reading this — especially those I’ve worked with, partnered with, or respected over the years — this isn’t an accusation.

It’s an appeal.

> *“When conviction gets watered down in the name of unity, it’s not the Kingdom we’re building. It’s a golden calf.”*

We don’t have to keep pouring creativity, capital, and credibility into systems that were flawed from the start. There’s a better way — and I’m walking it now, even if I walk it alone.

If you see it too, I welcome you to walk with me.
