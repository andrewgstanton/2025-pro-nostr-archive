Stanton*\n\n---\n\n## Introduction: All Systems Are Not Created Equal\n\nIn the past several years, I’ve experienced both the promise and the pain of working inside emerging technologies. Like many others, I was drawn into the world of “Web3,” hoping it would deliver on ideals like decentralization, freedom, and innovation.\n\nBut after countless hours, dollars, and conversations, I’ve come to a stark realization:\n\n> Not all protocols are neutral. Not all losses are personal mistakes.  \n> Some are structural. Some are spiritual.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between building on **Bitcoin** and building on **Web3/NFT systems** — and it’s not just technical. It’s ethical. It’s economic. It’s theological.\n\n---\n\n## Why Bitcoin Is Different\n\nBitcoin isn’t perfect. It’s not “God’s money.” But its architecture reflects **biblical values** and **moral clarity** in ways no other digital system does:\n\n- **Fixed supply** — no insider inflation  \n- **Open access** — no privileged actors  \n- **Immutable history** — no rewriting the ledger  \n- **No premines, no backdoors, no yield traps**\n\nBitcoin assumes that **humans are fallible**, and it builds accordingly. Trust is minimized, verification is enforced, and no one is above the rules — not the devs, not the early adopters, not the institutions.\n\nAnd that’s why its **protocol-level loss rate** remains near zero.\n\n---\n\n## The Web3 Reality: A System Built to Fail\n\nIn contrast, Web3 — for all its innovation — has proven to be a **structural trap** for capital, trust, and time. It is an ecosystem designed to reward:\n\n- Early insiders and privileged allocations  \n- Speculation over stewardship  \n- Governance by social influence  \n- Yield divorced from productivity  \n- Hype over truth\n\nThese aren’t bugs. They’re features.  \nAnd they have cost billions — not just in value, but in **credibility and witness**.\n\n---\n\n## My Personal Ledger: Losses by System\n\n>  Note: These are estimates only — not an exact financial accounting. Most of these losses reflect wasted time, misaligned energy, and systemic distractions rather than direct capital losses.\n\n> In fact, I made approximately $10,000 in realized gains trading altcoins during certain periods. But looking back, the opportunity cost — in clarity, conviction, and direction — far outweighed those short-term wins.\n\nHere is a personal comparison of how my capital and time fared in Bitcoin vs. Web3 environments:\n\n| Category                                      | Bitcoin Impact (USD) | Web3/NFT Impact (USD) |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Protocol flaws / inflation bugs              | $0                    | $15,000               |\n| Governance-based losses                      | $0                    | $8,000                |\n| Rug pulls / insider trading losses           | $0                    | $25,000               |\n| Deplatforming / access issues                | $0                    | $2,000                |\n| Staking collapses / yield model failures     | $0                    | $18,000               |\n| Time wasted on unstable ecosystems           | $5,000                | $10,000               |\n| Emotional burnout from hype cycles           | $2,000                | $5,000                |\n| Chasing shifting narratives (alts, L2s, etc) | $3,000                | $12,000               |\n| **TOTAL**                                    | **$10,000**           | **$95,000**           |\n\n> Bitcoin’s losses were emotional or opportunity-based.  \n> Web3’s losses were **systemic and avoidable — by design.**\n\n---\n\n## The Global Ledger: A Structural Failure\n\nIt’s not just me. These are the global losses from major Web3 ecosystem failures:\n\n| Event / Category                                      | Estimated Loss (USD, Billions) |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Terra/LUNA + Anchor + UST collapse                   | $40.0B                          |\n| FTX exchange collapse                                | $8.0B                           |\n| Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi bankruptcies               | $5.0B                           |\n| Ronin Bridge hack (Axie Infinity)                    | $0.6B                           |\n| Wormhole exploit (Solana ↔ Ethereum bridge)          | $0.3B                           |\n| Alt-L1 rug pulls & NFT wash trading                  | $3.5B                           |\n| DAO governance abuse / treasury exploits             | $0.5B                           |\n| Yield ponzis (Wonderland, OlympusDAO, etc.)          | $1.5B                           |\n| **TOTAL**                                            | **$59.4B**                      |\n\nNone of these are one-off accidents.  \nThey are the **natural result** of systems that empower human manipulation and reward trust over truth.\n\n---\n\n## Why I Built Continuum\n\nThis is why I’m building **Continuum** — not on Bitcoin directly, but on **Nostr**, a protocol that applies Bitcoin’s core principles to **identity** and **publishing**.\n\nContinuum is about giving people the ability to:\n- Own their identity  \n- Own their voice  \n- Own their network  \n- Without relying on platforms, tokens, or trusted middlemen\n\nWe are not trying to tokenize identity. We are not staking attention.  \nWe are building on rock — not sand.\n\n---\n\n## Final Word: An Appeal, Not an Attack\n\nTo those reading this — especially those I’ve worked with, partnered with, or respected over the years — this isn’t an accusation.\n\nIt’s an appeal.\n\n> *“When conviction gets watered down in the name of unity, it’s not the Kingdom we’re building. It’s a golden calf.”*\n\nWe don’t have to keep pouring creativity, capital, and credibility into systems that were flawed from the start. There’s a better way — and I’m walking it now, even if I walk it alone.\n\nIf you see it too, I welcome you to walk with me.\n\n– Andrew G. Stanton",
