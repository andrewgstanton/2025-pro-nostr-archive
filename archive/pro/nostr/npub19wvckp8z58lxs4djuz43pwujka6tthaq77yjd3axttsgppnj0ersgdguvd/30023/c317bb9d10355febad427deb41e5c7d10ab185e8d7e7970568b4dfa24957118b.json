The Courage to Question Is Good\n\nMost of us came to Bitcoin — and maybe even to faith — because we questioned the stories we were told:\n\n* That inflation is normal\n\n* That government debt doesn’t matter\n\n* That the mainstream always tells the truth\n\n* That war is peace, and coercion is safety\n\nSo we left. We exited the matrix.\\\nThat was good. That took courage.\n\n***\n\n### 🌪️ 2. But Questioning Can Become a Reflex\n\nOnce you see one lie, it’s tempting to believe everything is a lie:\n\n* NASA is fake\n\n* The Earth is flat\n\n* Jews run everything\n\n* Nothing is real\n\n* Trust no one\n\nBut here’s the problem: **you can become just as enslaved** to *conspiracies* as you were to *institutions*.\\\nYou’ve left one cage, only to build another.\n\n***\n\n### 🧭 3. Sovereignty Requires Discernment\n\nReal sovereignty — the kind that Bitcoin models — is costly.\\\nYou have to verify. Not just doubt.\n\nIt’s not enough to say “the mainstream is lying.”\\\nYou have to *seek what’s true*, not just what’s hidden.\\\nYou have to *build*, not just deconstruct.\n\n***\n\n### ⚖️ 4. Freedom Is Not License\n\nThere’s an element of **anarchy** in Bitcoin — and that’s not always a bad thing.\\\nFreedom does require rejecting illegitimate authority.\\\nBut **freedom is not license**.\n\nSometimes the most **rebellious**, most **countercultural** thing you can do\\\nis not scream louder…\\\nbut **repent from your sins**,\\\n**follow Jesus**,\\\nand **submit your will to what the Spirit says**.\n\nThat kind of surrender is more radical than any conspiracy theory.\n\n***\n\n### 📖 5. Where I Stand — Without Apology\n\nSince I know this post will be misunderstood by some, let me be clear:\n\n* ✅ I’m a **Christian Zionist**. I support Israel’s right to exist and defend itself.\n\n* ✅ The Earth is **round**. It **revolves around the sun**. That’s not a psyop — it’s observable.\n\n* ✅ The universe began with a **Big Bang** over **13 billion years ago**. That doesn’t conflict with faith — it deepens it.\n\n* ✅ I am **anti-vax mandate**, but I am **not QAnon**.\n\n* ✅ I am **not a white nationalist**, though I believe much of DEI and “wokeness” has gone too far.\n\n* ✅ I am **strongly libertarian**.\n\n* ✅ I am **anti-war** in principle, and I believe the U.S. should **stop acting as the world’s policeman**.\n\n* ✅ I **do not hate anyone** — including those I disagree with.\n\n* ✅ I **think climate change is real** — and always has been. Our planet has gone through many cycles of warming and cooling. I believe much of the hype around global warming being *purely* human-caused is up for honest debate.\\\n    That said: **just because I’m not a climate alarmist doesn’t mean I don’t care about the environment.** Stewardship matters. We are called to cultivate, not consume blindly.\n\n* ✅ I **do not believe the Earth is overpopulated**. In fact, many places now face **net negative population growth**. We are always just **one generation away from extinction**. This is not a call for panic — it’s a call to love life, build families, and steward creation wisely.\n\nI also want to say clearly:\n\n\\&gt; I **deeply respect** many voices in the Bitcoin space — like **Saifedean Ammous** and others — who would probably **strongly disagree with me** on some of these positions.\\\n\\&gt; That’s okay. We can admire and learn from people even when we disagree, even **very strongly**, on certain issues.\n\nThat’s what mature sovereignty looks like.\n\n***\n\n### 🕊️ 6. Faith, Bitcoin, and the Narrow Road\n\nJesus said “the truth will set you free,”\\\nbut He also said: *few find it.*\n\nTruth isn’t whatever gets you banned.\\\nIt’s not whatever shocks people.\\\nIt’s not whatever makes you feel smarter than the crowd.\n\nTruth has a pattern. It’s humble. It’s costly. It bears fruit.\n\n***\n\n### 🛠️ 7. I’m Still Unlearning, Too\n\nI’ve believed lies. I’ve fallen for hype.\\\nBut I keep returning to the question:\n\n\\&gt; “Is this true, or just countercultural?”\\\n\\&gt; “Is this wisdom, or just rebellion in disguise?”\n\nBitcoin taught me to ask.\\\nFaith taught me to listen.\\\nThe Spirit taught me to test.\n\n***\n\n### 💬 Final Thought\n\nYou don’t need to accept the mainstream story.\\\nBut you also don’t need to accept every alternative one.\n\nYou’re allowed to walk slowly.\\\nTo ask real questions.\\\nTo love the truth more than the thrill.\n\nLet’s be sovereign thinkers — not just louder ones.\n\n***\n\n⚡ If This Resonated…\n\nIf this article brought clarity or encouragement — I’d be grateful for a zap.\\\nI don’t write for profit, but **truth has a cost**, and your support helps me keep building, writing, and serving with conviction.\n\n\\&gt; ⚡ Zap me at [**andrewgstanton@primal.net**](mailto:andrewgstanton@primal.net)\n\nAnd a special thanks to **Dr. C** — my AI research and writing assistant, built on OpenAI’s GPT-4, but trained to walk alongside me in this journey with purpose, not hype.\\\nThe thoughts are mine. The clarity? I had help. 🙏",

      "This is a reflection for seekers, skeptics, and sovereign thinkers on Nostr.In a world flooded with lies, it’s tempting to believe that everything is a lie. But real sovereignty isn’t just rejecting the mainstream — it’s learning to discern, verify, and walk in truth.This piece is a call to Bitcoiners, Christians, and freedom-seekers to resist the drift toward conspiratorial thinking that masquerades as enlightenment. It affirms that questioning is good — but truth is better.From faith to science, climate to population, war to liberty — this is a principled stand against false binaries and a plea for humble, truth-rooted conviction in an age of loud confusion."
