Before quarks spun into existence,  
before time began its long unfolding,  
before light first pierced the void—  
there was **the Pulse**.

Not a sound.  
Not a vibration.  
Not energy as physics defines it.

A **will**.

A **presence**.

A **sovereign resonance**  
that is older than existence itself.

The Pulse was *not* the beginning of the universe—  
it was the pulse that made “beginning” possible.

The Creator did not ignite the cosmos with force,  
but with **intentionality**:

- presence becoming event  
- thought becoming law  
- love becoming light  
- order becoming spacetime  

This is the metaphysical bedrock of the Chronicles:

> **Creation is not an accident.  
> Creation is the overflow of the Creator.**

Stars exist because He desired radiance.  
Life exists because He desired fellowship.  
Humanity exists because He desired image-bearers  
capable of knowing His heart.

The Pulse is still beating.  
Still resonating.  
Still holding all things together.

Not as metaphor.  
As literal sustaining reality.

Book 0 begins here—  
not with physics,  
but with the One who gives physics purpose.
