Humanity’s greatest works were never built for immediate use. Cathedrals took centuries to complete. Libraries outlasted empires. Communities flourished long after their founders died. These were acts of low time preference: building what you will not see.

Fiat culture finds this foolish. It rewards immediacy, quarterly returns, and instant gratification. Why build for tomorrow when today’s profits can be consumed? Why invest in stone when plywood will do? But sovereign builders resist this logic. They know mortality. They know they will not see the harvest. And they build anyway.

Cathedral builders trusted their children’s children to finish the work. Their humility was their strength. They accepted mortality but refused futility. To lay one stone in faith was an act of defiance against death. Every arch unfinished mocked mortality’s grip. The cathedral would outlast them.

Today, we face similar choices. Will we build for short-term gain, or will we build for generations? Bitcoiners know the answer. To hold, to mine, to develop code that will endure, is to build for a future we may never see. Bitcoin is cathedral money, incorruptible and generational. To contribute is to confess that sovereignty is bigger than self.

Faith frames this even deeper. “One sows and another reaps” (John 4:37). The kingdom of God is built across generations. Saints labor, martyrs die, churches rise, and eternity endures. To build what you will not see is to trust in God’s sovereignty and Christ’s resurrection. Death does not end the story; resurrection continues it.

In every act of long-term building, we mock death. We say: you cannot stop us. You will take our breath, but not our legacy. Cathedrals rise, code endures, Bitcoin holds, faith remains. Sovereign builders invest in futures they will not see, because hope is stronger than death. That is sovereignty, and that is freedom.

## Acknowledgement

This article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.

I dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.

## Zaps Appreciated
If this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.
