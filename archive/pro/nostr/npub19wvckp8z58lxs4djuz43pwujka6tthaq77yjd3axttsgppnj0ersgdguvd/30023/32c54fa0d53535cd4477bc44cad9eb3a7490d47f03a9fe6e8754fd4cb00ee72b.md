Andrew G. Stanton - Dec. 27, 2025

I’m doing two kinds of work at the same time.

I’m writing — essays, long-form pieces, speculative fiction, and reflections on sovereignty, faith, Bitcoin, and the shape of the future.

And I’m building the infrastructure that allows that writing to exist without asking permission.

Continuum is the name I’ve given to that infrastructure.

### The problem I’m responding to

Most publishing platforms today are optimized for three things:
- Reach
- Engagement
- Recurring payment extraction

They are not optimized for:
- Author ownership
- Long-term durability
- Resistance to censorship or financial gatekeeping
- Direct relationships between writer and reader

This isn’t because the people running them are evil. It’s because centralized platforms inevitably become choke points. Payments flow through a small number of processors. Distribution flows through opaque algorithms. Accounts can be throttled, demonetized, or removed — often without appeal.

If you rely on these systems long enough, you eventually learn an uncomfortable truth:

You don’t really own your work there.

### What “local-first publishing” means

Continuum takes a different approach.

At a high level, local-first means that authorship begins with the author, not with a platform.

The canonical copy of my writing lives with me. Publishing starts locally and radiates outward. Identity is cryptographic rather than account-based, and access control is handled by keys instead of subscriptions.

In practice, this means my work is created, signed, and timestamped before it is distributed anywhere else. Relays and clients are delivery mechanisms — not authorities.

What this looks like in concrete terms, and what it explicitly does *not* mean, matters enough that it’s worth explaining more carefully below.

### What “local-first” actually means (and what it explicitly does not)

When I say “local-first publishing,” I mean something very specific — and narrower than how the term is often used.

Local-first does **not** simply mean:
- I self-host a website
- I own my private keys
- I sign events in a Nostr client
- I publish from multiple apps using the same identity

All of those can still be *client-first* or *platform-mediated*.

Local-first means that the **entire publishing lifecycle originates locally**, under my direct control.

Concretely, in my setup:
- Continuum runs in my own local environment (`localhost`)
- I create drafts of notes and articles locally
- Drafts can exist indefinitely without being published
- Drafts are stored locally and can be exported, archived, or discarded without ever touching a platform.
- When I choose to publish, the event is constructed and signed locally
- Encryption (for paid or private content) happens locally
- The signed event is then broadcast outward to relays as a transport step

The key distinction is this:

**No external client or hosted service constructs the event for me.**

Many tools allow you to *use* your private key.  
Local-first means no tool decides *when*, *how*, or *whether* that key is used.

In a client-first model:
- Writing happens inside the client
- Drafts live on someone else’s infrastructure
- Publishing is inseparable from the client’s UI and policies
- If the client disappears, the workflow breaks

In a local-first model:
- Writing exists independently of any client
- Drafts are first-class and offline-capable
- Publishing is an explicit, deliberate act
- Clients and relays are interchangeable delivery mechanisms

Local-first includes self-hosting, but it is not limited to it.

It is fundamentally about **where authorship begins**, not where content ends up.


### Paid writing without payment processors

One of the more unusual things I’m doing is publishing some long-form essays as encrypted posts.

The title, summary, and metadata are public. The body is encrypted.

Readers who want to unlock the piece do so directly — typically with sats — and receive access to the content itself, not a subscription tier.

There is no Stripe account.
No subscription lock-in.
No centralized payment gatekeeper.

This approach is still early and intentionally simple. I’m not doing it because it’s trendy. I’m doing it because it restores a direct exchange between writer and reader that most modern platforms have broken.

### Why I’m building infrastructure instead of just writing

I could write exclusively on existing platforms. Many people do.

But if I believe what I’m writing — about sovereignty, responsibility, freedom, and long time horizons — then it matters that the medium reflects the message.

Continuum exists because I didn’t want to spend the next decade:
- Explaining ideas about independence
- While depending on systems that quietly undermine it

Infrastructure is slower than content.
It’s lonelier.
And it’s often invisible until something breaks.

But when it works, it outlasts trends.

### Who this is for (and who it isn’t)

Continuum is not for everyone.

It’s not optimized for:
- Virality
- Growth hacking
- Mass onboarding
- Infinite scroll consumption

It is for:
- Writers who care about ownership
- Builders who think in decades
- Readers who value durability over novelty
- Anyone who has felt the fragility of platform dependence

You don’t need to agree with everything I write to understand why this matters. You only need to recognize that systems shape behavior — and that some systems are worth rebuilding from first principles.

### Closing

I’m not building Continuum to win an argument or chase a market.

I’m building it because I want my work — and the work of others who care about these things — to exist on solid ground.

Quietly.
Deliberately.
And without asking permission.

That’s the work.
