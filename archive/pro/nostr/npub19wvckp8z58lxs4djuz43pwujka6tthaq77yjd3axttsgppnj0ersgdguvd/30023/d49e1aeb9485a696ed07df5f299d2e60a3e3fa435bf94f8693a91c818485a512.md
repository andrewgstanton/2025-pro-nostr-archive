There’s a kind of ache that rises when you look at the night sky — not just wonder, but homesickness for something you’ve never known.  
Astronomers call it curiosity; poets call it longing.  
Scripture calls it eternity written on the heart.  

We are beings of dust, yet our gaze is always upward.  
We study the heavens, we build rockets, we dream of living among the stars — and still, when the engines go silent, we whisper prayers from within our helmets.  
We know, deep down, that we don’t belong there yet.  

When I imagine humans settling the Moon or Mars, I think of how fragile we truly are.  
We carry Earth inside us — its microbes, its air, its memories.  
Even the water we drink and the food we grow must echo the chemistry of home.  
We’re not conquerors of space; we’re dependents of a gracious planet.  

Maybe that’s the truth buried in Genesis: we were made from dust, not starlight.  
Our strength lies not in escaping our origin, but in redeeming it.  
Each act of exploration — each telescope pointed outward — is also a mirror pointed inward, reminding us who we are.  

I sometimes worry that in our rush to reach the stars, we’ll forget the soil beneath our feet.  
That we’ll trade the humility of stewardship for the pride of possession.  
But then I remember how every great frontier also revealed new dependence.  
Sailors once crossed oceans thinking they’d find limitless wealth; instead, they found fragility — they found their limits.  

Perhaps that’s what the Moon will teach us again: that even at our most advanced, we remain dust held together by grace.  

So I pray that when humanity finally lives off-world, we’ll carry that humility with us — that we’ll build not as owners, but as guests who have been invited to explore the house of God.  

The heavens will always belong to Him.  

But they still invite us — not to possess, but to wonder.  

And in that wonder, maybe we’ll find our truest home: not between dust or stars, but between both.
