Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 14, 2025

There’s a strange kind of fear that only builders experience — the moment you realize something you’ve been creating day after day, night after night, might be slipping through your fingers without warning. For most people it’s a corrupted file or a hard drive failure. For me, today, it was something subtler. I opened Primal to look through some of my older posts — the ones from back in May and June, the beginning of this entire journey — and realized they weren’t there.

Not on Primal.  
Not on Coracle.  
Not on Snort.  
Not on any of the relays Continuum talks to.

I didn’t panic immediately. At this point I’ve become so used to glitches that I almost assume there will be one or two surprises lurking at any given moment. But when I checked the relay fetch logs and saw *nothing* coming back for those early months, a kind of quiet fear crept in. My mind didn’t go to “years” of work lost — because honestly, I’ve only been on Nostr since May — but what *did* hit me was this:

**Six months of daily writing is a lot.  
And losing the foundations felt like losing the roots of a tree.**

Maybe that sounds dramatic. But writing for me isn’t a hobby anymore. It’s how I process, how I create, how I breathe. Continuum itself was born out of this daily rhythm — a structure that formed around my own writing life. To lose even the earliest posts, the ones that seeded everything else, felt like watching the beginning of a story get erased.

And the strangest part?  
They *weren’t* gone.

They were just… nowhere except in Primal’s internal backup directory.

If you know anything about Nostr, you know that every client has its own quirks. Primal tries to keep a record of what you’ve posted, so even if relays lose track, the client itself can still render something. It’s a kind of “client failsafe,” not really meant to be the canonical source of truth. But today, it was the only reason I could still see what I’d written in the early months.

Which is exactly the problem.

Relay systems are supposed to be decentralized, redundant, durable. In theory. But durability doesn’t come for free, not unless you architect it deliberately. And I hadn’t — at least not yet. Continuum fetched, displayed, mirrored, sorted, published… but it didn’t archive. Not in a sovereign way. Not in a way that guaranteed anything beyond “I hope the relays behave.”

Hope is not a system.

And relays, as it turns out, are not archives.

My first instinct — the instinct of a tired builder running on fumes — was to fix it fast. So I went into my dev environment and built what I thought was the solution: a rebroadcasting flow.

“Maybe,” I told myself, “the relays just need a nudge. Maybe my early posts were pruned or shuffled or deprioritized. If I just rebroadcast them, they’ll become visible again. Problem solved.”

This is the part in the story where you can hear the ominous music.

Because the truth was: rebroadcasting wasn’t going to solve anything.

But at the time, it felt like progress. I wrote the logic, tested it, wired it into the dashboard, and watched the events go out again. Everything *looked* like it should have worked. They were signed. Valid. Properly shaped. Sent out cleanly. Relays accepted them. Logs were clean.

And yet… nothing changed.

On every relay I checked, the old events refused to surface. It was like yelling into a canyon and hearing no echo. They were technically “published,” yes — but the canonical history still wasn’t reconstructable. If the relays had dropped them for any reason (age windowing, purging, indexing issues, whatever), then rebroadcasting wasn’t enough to restore the historical continuity.

What I really needed — and had been avoiding for months — was an *actual* archive.

Not a mirror.  
Not a rebroadcasting pipeline.  
And not a dependency on someone else’s backup folder.

I needed something sovereign.

But it was Friday. I was exhausted. And I wasn’t ready to build it yet.

***

There’s an exhaustion that comes not from physical labor but from feeling like everything you do is uphill. From trying to dog-sit through Nextdoor with no takers. From staying listed on Rover even though it takes a chunk of every transaction. From setting up Kiyomi’s entire website in a single afternoon. From the constant churn of walled gardens where everything feels like resistance.

And today, the resistance took a new form:  
**my oldest work drifting toward non-existence.**

Not gone — but definitely not safe.

It’s strange how quickly your emotions can shift from “I’m too tired to deal with this” to “If I don’t solve this, I’m going to lose something important.” But I didn’t solve it today. I made a good attempt — the rebroadcasting flow is fine, and it may be useful later — but it didn’t fix the real issue.

Friday was the day I *discovered the fragility*.

Saturday would be the day I *solved it*.

But tonight, I’m ending the day with a mix of frustration and resignation. My early months on Nostr aren’t “years of work,” but they’ve been some of the most intense, prolific, meaningful creative months I’ve ever lived. Seeing those oldest pieces hanging by a thread hit me harder than I expected.

Not because of the content itself — though some of those early essays mean a lot to me — but because of what they represent: the beginning of Continuum, the seed of this entire experiment in sovereignty.

And tonight, they feel too fragile.

Tomorrow, I fix that.  
But I didn’t know that yet.

Tonight, I just know this:  
**I’m tired, my oldest work is disappearing, and rebroadcasting didn’t save it.**  
And sometimes the only thing you can do is sit with that truth for a moment, before the next breakthrough comes.
