  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Sept. 28, 2025\n\nSunday morning came warm and clear. Heather and I left Kukui Plaza just after nine and walked toward Kawaiahaʻo Church, the bells already echoing through downtown Honolulu. The trade winds carried the scent of plumeria and asphalt — the everyday mingled with the eternal.\n\nThe service began at 9:30 a.m. Coral-stone walls held the sound of hymns sung in Hawaiian and English, voices rising through open windows into a bright sky. The rhythm was unhurried, reverent. It felt like a language the island still remembered by heart.\n\nThe night before, after we returned from clearing out Dad’s office, I had written a prayer with Dr. C — our conversation had turned to Hawaiian words for peace and release. Line by line, English and Hawaiian took shape together until the pule felt complete, simple, and true. I saved it on my iPhone, not knowing exactly when I would share it.\n\nAfter the benediction, I approached the Kahu near the front steps.\n“I wrote a prayer for my father,” I said.\nHe smiled, waiting. I opened my phone and showed him the screen. He read it slowly, lips moving softly with the Hawaiian lines. When he finished, he looked up and said, ʻĀmene. That was all — but it felt like heaven itself had answered.\n\nPule no James Stanton\n\nE ka Haku aloha,\nKe hoʻāla nei mākou i ko mākou leo no James Stanton.\nUa pau ka hele ʻana ma kēia ao,\na ua mākaukau kona naʻau e hoʻi i kou alo.\n\nE lawe mālie ʻO ʻIesū i kona lima,\nE alakaʻi i kona ʻuhane i kou hale mau loa.\nE hoʻomaha ʻo ia i loko o kou aloha,\nA e loaʻa ka maluhia e ao pau ʻole.\n\nHoʻomaikaʻi mākou iā ʻoe no ke ola i hā‘awi ʻia mai,\nA hā‘awi mākou iā ia i kou mālama mau loa.\n\nMa ka inoa o Iesu Kristo mākou e pule aku ai,\nʻĀmene.\n\nPrayer for James Stanton\n\nBeloved Lord,\nWe lift our voices for James Stanton.\nHis journey in this world is complete,\nand his heart is ready to return to Your presence.\n\nTake him gently by the hand, O Jesus,\nand guide his spirit into Your eternal home.\nMay he rest in Your love,\nand find peace without end.\n\nWe thank You for the life that was given,\nand we entrust him now into Your everlasting care.\n\nIn the name of Jesus Christ we pray,\nAmen.\n\nWe left the church around eleven and stopped at a small chocolate-and-coffee shop nearby — local cacao grown right here on Oʻahu. The bars were nine dollars each: passion fruit, guava, sea-salted caramel. Their flavor was distinctly semi-sweet — not as sugary as Ghirardelli or See’s, but still rich and satisfying, more like the island itself — honest, layered, alive. I remember thinking that Dad would have liked them for that reason alone.\n\nBy early afternoon we were back at the Queen Street apartment. Shirling sat beside Dad, the oxygen tank hissing softly. We exchanged it for a larger one and began administering morphine through the feeding tube. He had gone eight days without food, ten without dialysis. Each breath felt like grace measured in seconds.\n\nThe hours passed slowly. In the evenings, Dad was often more awake — eyes opening, sometimes smiling faintly when he recognized a voice or a face. That night was no different. He seemed peaceful, breathing evenly, aware in the quiet way that becomes its own form of communication.\n\nAround 10:30 p.m., Fred left with Duke after a small tiff with Shirling. The apartment felt tender and fragile — love and fatigue brushing up against one another. Liz offered to drive me back to Kukui Plaza using Shirling’s car, and I accepted. Fred was planning to take me to the airport the next morning.\n\nBefore leaving, I said goodbye to Dad. He was resting, eyes half-open, and I told him softly that I loved him. I knew, almost certainly, that it would be the last time I saw him alive. Yet the moment wasn’t filled with despair; it was filled with stillness — the kind of quiet that only comes when every word has already been said in other ways.\n\nAs we drove through the city, the lights reflected on the windows of high-rises and cars, and I felt an odd calm. The line from the prayer echoed again: E lawe mālie ʻO ʻIesū i kona lima — Take him gently by the hand, O Jesus.\n\nHe was still breathing when I left, and he would linger almost another full day — until 5:30 p.m. the next evening. But in my heart, I had already released him into that gentle hand.",
