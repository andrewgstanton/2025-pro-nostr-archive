Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 23, 2025

It started quietly on **Tuesday morning**. Whiskers stumbled, folded to the floor, then—after a few long seconds—stood back up and shook it off. By midday he was normal again: eating, walking, curling up in his favorite corner as if nothing had happened.  

**Wednesday** passed without incident, though he moved slower than usual. We watched him more closely, sensing something subtle had shifted, a rhythm off by just enough to make you listen harder. That night his breathing grew heavier—**fifty to sixty breaths per minute**, faster than it should have been. Still, he seemed calm, alert, even affectionate. We decided to watch through the night.  

Then came **Thursday morning, October 23**. Another collapse—this time harder, unmistakable. His chest rose and fell so quickly it felt like air couldn’t reach him. We called **SAGE**, ordered an **Uber**, and arrived at **9:30 a.m.**  

They took him in right away, placed him in a **clear oxygen-rich box**, and began running tests. The vet told us his breathing had reached **seventy-two breaths per minute** when he arrived. Numbers like that make you understand how fragile a heartbeat is—not just his, but everyone’s.  

They said it would take two hours.  

We stepped outside to wait. The morning light felt too bright, the air too normal for the weight of what was happening. Across the street, a **ceramics factory** gleamed with hand-painted tiles and pottery. We wandered in because we couldn’t just stand still. A man named **James** was tending the counter. I asked about the prices—each bowl, each vase seemed steep even for San Francisco. He sighed and said, “We keep raising them. Clay, glaze, rent, electricity—everything’s getting more expensive.”  

I looked at the shelves of hardened clay and thought how strange it was: these pieces, fired to endure centuries, growing more “valuable” only because the money measuring them keeps eroding. Even permanence can’t escape inflation.  

Meanwhile, across the street, a small life fought for every breath.

Two hours later, we returned. The vet’s tone was steady but gentle. “He’s improving. The oxygen helped. We’ll keep him until evening.”  

When I picked him up around **7 p.m.**, his breathing had slowed to **twenty-four per minute**—nearly normal. I carried him home, lighter than I remembered, his head resting against my arm.  

Now, as I write this, he’s beside me again, sleeping softly. The hum of the oxygen room still echoes in my mind—the steady hiss of machines standing guard over a mystery they can’t explain.

### The Lesson Hidden in Breath  

Life feels continuous until it doesn’t. Until it narrows into a number—seventy-two—and you realize existence is a rhythm that could skip at any time.  

We think of fragility as weakness, but maybe it’s sacred. The same breath that can fail is the one that gives meaning to every moment before it does.  

I keep thinking of that box at SAGE, glowing faintly under hospital lights. The vet adjusting knobs. The slow decline of a number from seventy-two to forty, then thirty, then twenty-four. Watching a living being cross back over that invisible threshold—back from chaos into calm—is like seeing resurrection written in data.  

You start to realize: the border between life and death is not a wall. It’s a veil. Thin, permeable, trembling.

### Between Matter and Meaning  

In the oxygen box, there was no room for metaphor—only numbers, tubes, and hope. But later, walking past the ceramics shop again, the symbolism returned. Clay, when fired, becomes something new: transformed by heat, hardened by time. It is fragile until it isn’t.  

Maybe that’s the story written into all of us. We are the un-fired clay—soft, vulnerable, able to be reshaped by every breath we take. We spend our days trying to avoid the heat, yet it’s that very fire that gives permanence to anything at all.  

Whiskers doesn’t know this, of course. He just breathes. He lives in the purity of the present—no concept of tomorrow, no fear of loss. Watching him sleep tonight, I envy that simplicity.

### What the Day Revealed  

Today reminded me that the line between gratitude and grief is only a breath wide. Every inhale says *thank you*. Every exhale says *let go*.  

When you sit beside someone fragile, counting breaths, time changes texture. It stops flowing forward; it hovers. You begin to understand eternity not as endlessness, but as depth—a single moment lived completely.  

That’s the breath between worlds: the space where science meets soul, where love refuses to vanish even when flesh begins to fail.  

---

Whiskers is still here tonight. He’s sleeping peacefully, the numbers better, the rhythm steady. I know that won’t always be true. But for now, I’m learning to measure time not in hours or days, but in the rise and fall of his chest—the most honest clock there is.  

Because life, at its core, isn’t measured by how long it lasts, but by how deeply we notice it while it’s here.  

And tonight, I notice everything.
