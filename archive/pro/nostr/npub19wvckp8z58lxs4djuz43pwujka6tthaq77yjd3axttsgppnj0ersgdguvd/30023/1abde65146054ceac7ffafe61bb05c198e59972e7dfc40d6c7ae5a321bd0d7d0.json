  "content": "### Author’s Note — On Meaning, Faith, and Building  \n\nWhen I write about cathedrals, light, and builders of freedom, I’m not describing a new religion.  \nI’m describing a way of thinking about truth.  \n\nArchitecture has always been one of humanity’s oldest metaphors for meaning.  \nEvery enduring structure — from a stone cathedral to a line of open-source code — is, in its own way, a statement of faith in continuity. Not necessarily faith in God, but faith in what is honest, transparent, and worth preserving.  \n\nBitcoin, Nostr, and Continuum aren’t sacred in themselves. They are **technologies of integrity** — systems designed so that truth doesn’t depend on permission or power. When I call them “cathedrals,” it’s because they embody that same human impulse: to build something that outlasts corruption.  \n\nThere is a spiritual resonance in that, yes. But it’s not about doctrine.  \nIt’s about responsibility — the quiet realization that what we build carries moral weight. Openness, verification, and proof are not religious ideas; they’re civic virtues that make trust possible in a digital world.  \n\nMy language draws on the imagery of faith and craftsmanship because both speak to devotion — to care, precision, and endurance. But this work isn’t about founding a creed. It’s about cultivating culture: the kind that treats transparency as sacred and truth as public property.  \n\nI come to this as a person of faith in the **Victorious Gospel of Jesus Christ** — a gospel of redemption, renewal, and freedom — yet I write for all who seek integrity, regardless of creed.  \n\nTo me, freedom is not rebellion; it’s stewardship. \n \nAnd the systems we build in light — the ledgers, relays, words, and works that hold their form when tested — are not temples. They are *evidence* that honesty can still scale.  \n\nThat’s all Continuum is meant to be: a framework for sovereign creation, a way to build without fear or secrecy, and a reminder that light — whether spiritual or literal — is always worth keeping on.  \n\n— *Andrew G. Stanton*  \nOctober 15, 2025",
