Advent is not a delay tactic.

It is not a placeholder season, a liturgical loading screen before Christmas arrives. Advent is a discipline — one that trains us to live in time without trying to conquer it.

Waiting, in Scripture, is never passive. It is not the absence of action, but the refusal to act prematurely. It is restraint in a world that equates speed with intelligence and immediacy with strength.

We live in systems that do not know how to wait. Debt pulls future productivity into the present. Leverage compresses time. Optimization promises results without patience. Even spiritual language is often bent toward outcomes: growth, impact, momentum.

Advent interrupts that logic.

It insists that some things cannot be rushed without being ruined. That preparation matters as much as arrival. That formation precedes fulfillment.

Israel waited centuries for the Messiah — not because God was inefficient, but because humanity needed to be shaped to receive what was coming. The delay was not a failure of power; it was an expression of wisdom.

Waiting reveals what we trust.

When we wait, we discover whether we believe history is something we must force into submission, or something we are meant to inhabit faithfully. Advent teaches us to live inside time rather than trying to dominate it.

This is why Advent feels uncomfortable. It resists urgency. It denies the satisfaction of immediacy. It refuses to let us skip ahead to the resolution.

But without Advent, Christmas becomes sentiment instead of substance.

The Incarnation did not arrive on demand. It arrived “in the fullness of time.” And that fullness was prepared through waiting — through longing, silence, and endurance.

Advent is not about counting down days.

It is about learning how to wait without grasping — and discovering that waiting itself is a form of obedience.
