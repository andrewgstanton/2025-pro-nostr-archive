## **I. The Uncomfortable Truth: The New Testament Never Commands Christians to Tithe**
Many Christians assume that “tithing” (giving 10% of income) is a universal biblical requirement.

It isn’t.

Not once—**not a single time**—does the New Testament command Christians to give 10%.

Jesus never taught it.  
Paul never taught it.  
Peter and John never taught it.  
The early church never practiced it.

Instead, the New Testament emphasizes:

- generosity  
- cheerful giving  
- sacrificial love  
- Spirit-led stewardship  
- care for the poor  
- support for ministry  

But never a fixed percentage.

## **II. What Tithing Actually Was in the Old Testament**
Modern sermons often distort what the tithe truly was. Biblically, tithing was nothing like the modern “10% of your paycheck” model.

### **1. The tithe was agricultural, not monetary**
The tithe was **produce from the land of Israel**—not wages, salaries, profits, or general wealth.

> “The tithe of the *land*, whether of seed or fruit, is the Lord’s.”  
> — *Leviticus 27:30*

A carpenter did not tithe chairs.  
A fisherman did not tithe fish.  
A merchant did not tithe profits.

Only farmers and herdsmen tithed, and only from God’s promised land.

### **2. Israel had multiple tithes**
Israel’s tithes included:

- the **Levitical tithe** (for priests),  
- the **Festival tithe** (for national feasts),  
- the **Poor tithe** (every third year).  

Altogether, this functioned as a **national tax system** under Mosaic law.

### **3. Tithing ended with the Old Covenant**
Tithing belonged to:

- the Temple,  
- the Levitical priesthood,  
- the promised land of Israel.

All fulfilled or dissolved in Christ.

## **III. Why the New Testament Never Commands Christians to Tithe**
Because the New Covenant replaces law-based giving with **free, Spirit-formed generosity.**

Paul makes this unmistakably clear:

> “Each one must give as he has decided in his heart,  
> not reluctantly or under compulsion,  
> for God loves a cheerful giver.”  
> — *2 Corinthians 9:7*

Under the New Covenant:

- Giving is voluntary.  
- Giving is joyful.  
- Giving is relational.  
- Giving is Spirit-led.  
- Giving is proportional to ability.  
- Giving is an act of worship, not obligation.

There is no law, no percentage, no threat of curse.

## **IV. The Real New Testament Standard: Everything Belongs to God**
Ironically, modern tithing **lowers** the biblical standard.

“Give God 10%; keep the other 90%.”

But Jesus teaches that:

> **God owns 100% of everything we have.**

The New Testament vision is:

- full stewardship,  
- open-handed generosity,  
- sacrificial giving,  
- love for the poor,  
- support for the gospel,  
- and Spirit-guided offerings.

Christian giving is not a tax.  
It is worship.

---

## **V. But Should Christians Be Generous? Yes—More Than Ever**
Rejecting tithing does not reject generosity.

Christians are called to:

- give sacrificially,  
- support the needy,  
- strengthen the church,  
- care for missionaries,  
- and live open-handedly.

The New Covenant raises the bar.  
But it removes compulsion.

---

## **VI. The Problem With Modern Tithing Theology**
Tithing sermons often produce:

- guilt  
- superstition  
- prosperity formulas (“give to get”)  
- fear (“you’ll be cursed if you don’t”)  
- manipulation  
- or transactional spirituality  

But the New Covenant produces:

- joy  
- freedom  
- discernment  
- humility  
- generosity  
- overflowing love  

The issue is not “giving less.”  
It is **giving from the right covenant**.

## **VII. What About Abraham and Melchizedek?**
This is the most common argument used to justify tithing today.

> “Abraham tithed to Melchizedek—so Christians should tithe!”

But this misunderstands the passage completely.

### **1. Abraham tithed only once**
This was not regular giving.  
It occurred **one time** in his entire recorded life.

### **2. Abraham tithed from war spoils, not his own wealth**
Genesis 14 is clear: the tithe came from **plunder taken in battle**, not personal income.

Abraham never tithed:

- wages  
- flocks  
- crops  
- profits  
- inheritance  
- annual produce  

Just war plunder.

### **3. Abraham gave 10% and kept 0%**
He gave:

- 10% to Melchizedek,  
- **and the remaining 90% to the king of Sodom.**

If this were a model for Christians, then:

> “Give 10% to your pastor and 90% to your enemies.”

No one teaches that because the story is **not a command**.  
Not a pattern.  
Not a rule.

### **4. Hebrews never uses this as a giving command**
The New Testament uses Melchizedek to show **Christ’s superior priesthood**, not to teach tithing.

There is no command to imitate Abraham’s gesture.

---

## **VIII. What About Malachi 3? (“Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse…”)**
This is the second most common prooftext for tithing sermons.  
But it is consistently misinterpreted.

### **1. Malachi was written to Israel under Mosaic law**
Not to Christians.  
Not to the Church.  
Not under grace.

It addressed:

- agricultural tithes,  
- Temple service,  
- Levitical priests,  
- covenant curses,  
- and blessings tied to the land.

You cannot apply Malachi without re-imposing the entire Mosaic system.

### **2. The “storehouse” was a literal food warehouse**
The storehouse was where Israel stored:

- grain  
- wine  
- oil  
- produce  

Not money.  
Not salaries.  
Not modern offerings.

### **3. The blessings and curses were agricultural**
“I will pour out a blessing” referred to **rain and harvest**.  
“Devourer” referred to **locusts**.

Not finances.  
Not bank accounts.

### **4. The New Testament never repeats Malachi’s command**
Jesus and Paul both taught giving—  
but never repeated Malachi’s requirement.

Malachi is Old Covenant.  
Christians are not under it.

## **IX. Why These Two Passages Cannot Establish Christian Tithing**
Neither Genesis 14 nor Malachi 3 provides:

- a command to tithe today  
- a percentage requirement  
- a New Covenant obligation  
- support for pastoral salaries  
- a church budget model  
- a prosperity formula  
- a doctrine of spiritual cursing  

Using these texts to impose tithing is **mixing covenants** and misrepresenting Scripture.

---

## **X. The New Covenant Way: Generosity, Not Legalism**
Let’s state it plainly:

> **God is not asking for a percentage.  
He is asking for your heart.**

If the Spirit leads someone to give 10%, wonderful.  
If He leads them to give more, even better.  
If a struggling believer gives less for a time, that is grace—not sin.

Christian giving is:

- voluntary  
- cheerful  
- sacrificial  
- Spirit-led  
- proportionate  
- relational  
- and rooted in love  

**The tithe belonged to Israel.  
Generosity belongs to the Church.**
