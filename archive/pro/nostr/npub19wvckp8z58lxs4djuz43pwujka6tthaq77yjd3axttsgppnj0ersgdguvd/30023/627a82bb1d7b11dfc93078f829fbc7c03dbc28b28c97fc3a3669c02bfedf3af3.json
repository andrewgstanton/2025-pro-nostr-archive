  "content": "I’ve been pouring my heart into Continuum — building tools that let us live and work with digital sovereignty.\n\nEvery day I’m writing, coding, building, refining, publishing, archiving, and creating a space where our identities, our work, our stories, and our freedom aren’t trapped inside someone else’s platform.\n\nContinuum is:\n\n- **a sovereign publishing tool**  \n- **a multi-identity Nostr client**  \n- **a personal archive system**  \n- **a creative engine for the Bitcoin Chronicles**  \n- **a long-term ecosystem for self-sovereign work**\n\nI’m doing all of this independently — without VC money, without corporate funding, without selling control, and without compromising the vision.\n\nIf you’ve found value in my writing, conversations, or software, I’d love your support as a patron.\n\nYour support helps me:\n\n- keep Continuum independent  \n- build faster  \n- expand tools for creators and sovereign individuals  \n- release more of the Bitcoin Chronicles  \n- publish more theology, sovereignty essays, and long-form work  \n- maintain the infrastructure behind the sovereign archive  \n- continue developing new features week after week  \n\n**Patron package: $250 (1 time payment)**  \n(or sats, with a discount)\n\nIf you want to support the work, or you have questions, please reach out:\n\n**Support (including sats):** andrewgstanton@primal.net  \n\n**Questions or DM:** reach out to me directly on Nostr (@Akamaister on Primal)\n\n**For non-sats Patron support payments (Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc.):** DM me and I’ll share the details.\n\nThank you — truly — to everyone who’s been reading, zapping, encouraging, and walking with me through this journey.\n\nI’ll keep building.  \nI’ll keep writing.  \nAnd I’ll keep holding the line on sovereignty, creativity, and truth.\n\n— Andrew",
