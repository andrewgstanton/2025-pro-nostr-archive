  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Aug. 30, 2025\n\nTrade has begun. Mars, Earth, and the Moon are no longer isolated outposts but nodes in a fragile new economy. Metals mined from Martian rock, biotech grown in Earth’s labs, and freighters passing through the Lunar Freeport — all connected by the same network of trustless sats.\nThe first interplanetary trade routes are forming, and with them comes a new balance of power. No governments, no fiat — only Bitcoin.\n\n👉 Paid article: *The First Interplanetary Trade Routes*\n\n2 free articles today:\n\n- *Lunar Freeport: Gateway Between Earth and Mars*\n- *Zap Across the Void: Lightning in Deep Space*\n\n🔒 **Full article available for 500 sats.** Zap me and I’ll send it via encrypted DM while I finish building the automated unlock flow in Continuum.",
