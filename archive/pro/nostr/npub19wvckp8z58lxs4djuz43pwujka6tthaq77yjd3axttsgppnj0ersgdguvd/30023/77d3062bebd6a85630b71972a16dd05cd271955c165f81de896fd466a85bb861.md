Andrew G. Stanton — Sept. 1, 2025

Labor Day was meant to honor the dignity of workers — the sweat of their brows, the hours of their days, and the sacrifices made to win fair pay and humane conditions. Yet in 2025, the holiday often feels hollow. We celebrate “work” with barbecues and sales, while ignoring the deeper truth: the very money workers are paid in is broken. Inflation has turned every paycheck into a slow-motion theft.

Most people don’t think about inflation beyond headlines. They notice groceries are more expensive, or that saving for a home feels impossible, but they rarely connect those struggles to the design of money itself. Yet the link is direct. When central banks print new units of currency, the value of existing wages declines. A worker who labors for an hour at $20 may think they are paid fairly, but if the purchasing power of that $20 erodes year after year, the system is stealing from them without consent.

This theft is not new. Throughout history, rulers have clipped coins, debased metals, or printed paper to cover their debts. The result is always the same: workers carry the cost. Their labor is diluted, their savings destroyed, their future mortgaged to the decisions of those who control the presses. Today’s version is more sophisticated — balance sheets, stimulus packages, quantitative easing — but the impact is the same as in Rome or Weimar: the people who work hardest are punished hardest.

On Labor Day, we are told to honor the American worker. But what good is a holiday if the system undermines workers every other day of the year? What dignity is preserved when someone’s labor cannot be carried forward into the future without constant decay? The irony is that many workers now hold not just one job but two or three, yet still fall behind because their wages cannot keep pace with the devaluation of money.

Bitcoin changes this equation. It is the first money in history that cannot be manipulated at will. Its supply is capped, its issuance predictable, its value secured by the collective energy of miners and the consensus of its users. In Bitcoin, an hour of work stored as sats today will still be worth an hour of work tomorrow — not diluted by inflationary policies.

For workers, this is transformative. It means that stacking even small amounts can accumulate into lasting savings. It means wages can be preserved instead of drained. It means retirement planning does not have to rely on gambling in rigged stock markets or praying that pensions hold together. Bitcoin offers workers something fiat never can: a guarantee that their labor, once converted into money, will not be destroyed by policy.

Critics often scoff: “Workers can’t live on Bitcoin yet.” But this misses the point. Workers don’t live on fiat either — not really. They live on the goods and services fiat can still buy. When fiat breaks down, so does everything else. Bitcoin is not about instant utopia; it is about restoring fairness to the most basic exchange: time for value.

Imagine if the next labor movement wasn’t about wages or benefits, but about money itself. Imagine unions or co-ops demanding that part of their wages be paid in Bitcoin. Imagine workers opting out of the silent theft of inflation, choosing instead a money that respects their time. That shift would be more powerful than any march or protest. It would be labor reclaiming sovereignty at its root.

This Labor Day, we don’t need another sale at the mall. We need a reckoning with the fact that fiat money has hollowed out the meaning of labor. Workers are not losing because they are lazy or unskilled; they are losing because their time is priced in a currency designed to decline. Bitcoin restores what inflation steals: dignity, fairness, and the promise that labor is not in vain.
