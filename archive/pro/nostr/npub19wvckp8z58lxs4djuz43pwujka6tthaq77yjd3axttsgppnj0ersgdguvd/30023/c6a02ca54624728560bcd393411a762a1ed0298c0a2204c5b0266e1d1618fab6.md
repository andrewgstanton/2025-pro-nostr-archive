## **What This Chronicle Is (and Isn’t)**

This is not a work of “Christian fiction.”  
There are no allegories, no sermons hidden in story,  
no symbolic characters meant to represent doctrinal ideas.

This is something different.

The Bitcoin Chronicles is a **Christ-shaped cosmology** —  
a universe whose deep structure reflects the truth that  
all things were made through the Creator,  
all things hold together in Him,  
and the laws of physics themselves  
bear the imprint of His sovereignty.

Christ is not a character in this Chronicle.  
He is the architecture.

This story does not preach Him;  
it reveals the universe He authored.

Where modern Christian fiction often focuses on religion,  
this Chronicle focuses on **reality**:

- the structure of spacetime  
- the coherence of quantum fields  
- the physics of sovereignty  
- the fracture at the heart of human history  
- the long restoration unfolding across millennia  
- and the rediscovery of systems aligned with creation’s design

This is a story about humanity,  
about sovereignty,  
about the cosmos,  
and about the return to alignment  
with the architecture established from the beginning.

It is a science fiction universe built on a true metaphysics.  
A sovereign story in a Christ-ordered cosmos.

The Chronicle begins here —  
before the stars,  
before humanity,  
before history itself.

Welcome to the foundation.
