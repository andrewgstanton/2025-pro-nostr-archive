  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 9, 2025\n\nWe chase abundance as if it will silence our fears. More income, more attention, more data — anything to prove we’re secure. But the paradox of the age is that abundance has made us anxious. The more we hold, the less we rest. The problem isn’t lack; it’s the absence of *enough.*\n\nThe Sabbath is God’s counter-economy. It interrupts production, consumption, and ambition with one simple decree: *stop.* In stopping, we discover the Law of Enough — that creation itself is sufficient when received as gift, not as currency.\n\nIn Exodus, the manna stopped on the seventh day. Those who gathered extra found it spoiled. God wasn’t teaching logistics; He was teaching trust. He was showing that daily provision is not scarcity — it’s relationship. Dependence is the design, not the punishment.\n\nOur modern world calls that foolish. It says security comes from accumulation, not reliance. But accumulation breeds fear — the fear of losing what we hoard. Sabbath breaks that cycle. It declares that life is sustained by grace, not by grind.\n\nEnough isn’t a number; it’s a knowing. It’s the quiet confidence that the same hand that fed you yesterday will feed you tomorrow. It’s the point where striving becomes stewardship, and work turns back into worship.\n\nFor sovereign builders, this truth is everything. We can decentralize money, speech, and identity — but if we never decentralize *anxiety*, we’re still enslaved. Freedom without rest is just another form of toil.\n\nThe Law of Enough isn’t about lowering ambition. It’s about restoring balance. It reminds us that creation was called “very good” before humanity added productivity goals. To live under that law is to rediscover gratitude — to see work and rest not as opposites, but as partners in the same creation cycle.\n\nSo let the world race. Let algorithms scream for engagement. Let markets chase their next candle. You — rest. You have enough. The One who built galaxies in silence can handle your unfinished to-do list.\n\nEnough is not the end of ambition. It’s the beginning of peace.",
