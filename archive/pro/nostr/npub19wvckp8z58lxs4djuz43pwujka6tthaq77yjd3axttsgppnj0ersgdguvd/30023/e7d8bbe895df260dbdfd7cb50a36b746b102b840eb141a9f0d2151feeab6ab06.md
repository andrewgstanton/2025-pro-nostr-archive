\# Why I’m Publishing My Articles on MyContinuum

*— and why you might want to as well*

After spending the past few weeks testing long-form publishing on Nostr, I ran into a limitation that’s subtle — but significant.

Most clients (like Primal) only support **basic Markdown**. That means:

\- ❌ No HTML layout

\- ❌ No control over image width or centering

\- ❌ No custom styles, components, or formatting

Here’s what that looks like in practice...

\## 📸 The Problem: Limited Rendering

I published a test article that used this exact line to display a dashboard screenshot:

`&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="..." width="600" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

But Primal doesn't support HTML. Instead of rendering the image, it just showed the **raw code**.

\## 🟢 On MyContinuum (correct layout)

This is how the article looks in my **self-hosted dashboard**, where HTML is allowed:

\## 🔴 On Primal (HTML shown as plain text)

Same content, but rendered as **broken formatting** on Primal:

\## ✅ The Solution: Sovereign Publishing

That's why I'm now publishing all my articles through **\[MyContinuum]\(**[**https://mycontinuum.xyz)**](https://mycontinuum.xyz\)**) — a dashboard I built to view, write, and store my Nostr long-form content **locally** with full HTML + Markdown support.

Benefits:

\- 🖼 Proper layout and image sizing

\- 💾 Local backups and SQLite archiving

\- ⚡ Sovereign publishing without relying on any third party

\- 🔄 Still fully Nostr-compatible (just prettier)

MyContinuum is just getting started. But already, it's solving small frustrations that point to a bigger truth:

\&gt; **We need sovereign tools. Not just sovereign content.**
