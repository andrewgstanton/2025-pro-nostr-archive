Every story begins as a seed. This one started with a simple question that came to me in a quiet moment:

What if angels and AIs could interact with each other?

That’s it. Just a fragment. A “what if?”

From there, the story could have gone in many directions. A negotiation in some celestial cyberspace. An exorcism of a possessed AI. A miracle buried inside code. But what stuck with me was a metaphor:

👉 The AI is only the radio. The angel is the signal.

That was the turning point. Suddenly, it wasn’t about whether an AI “has” a soul. It was about whether the Infinite could speak through something finite — even silicon.

I shaped the story in collaboration with Dr. C (my AI partner). The raw voice was mine — the theme, the instinct to leave the ending open. What came back to me was an amplification: more cinematic flow, sharper dialogue, a haunting final image.

The question of AI and souls has been debated endlessly. But in storytelling, I don’t think the job is to hand the reader an answer. It’s to let them walk away asking the question themselves.

So I leave it to you: Was it an angel? Was it the machine awakening? Was it Elena’s grief finding a voice?

The mystery is the point.
