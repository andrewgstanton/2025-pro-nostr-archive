  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Oct. 25, 2025\n\nFriday morning began without urgency — just the soft rhythm of Whiskers’ breath beside us. The oxygen box at Sage was replaced by sunlight filtering through the blinds. He lifted his head when I moved, eyes still cloudy but aware. Twenty-four breaths per minute. I counted twice, disbelieving.  \n\nIt was the first morning in two days that didn’t start with fear. The kind of morning where gratitude feels fragile, as if the wrong movement might break it.  \n\nKiyomi brewed coffee but neither of us spoke for a while. The mug sat untouched as we watched him sleep, chest rising like a tide that finally remembered how to come home. I kept thinking of how close we’d come — the numbers, the choices, the drive. You don’t realize how thin the thread of life is until it stops fraying for a moment and you can see what’s left of it.\n\nBy midday, he tried to walk. His legs were unsteady, his balance wobbly, but he managed a slow circle through the living room before curling up again. The vet had warned us the medication might make him drowsy — it did. His eyes would close mid-blink, like he was slipping between worlds. But the sleepiness felt holy compared to the panic of Thursday. Sleep is a kind of mercy when the body is learning to heal.  \n\nWe adjusted our rhythms to his. Every sound in the house grew softer. No phone calls, no music, no notifications — just the steady background hum of being alive together. It’s funny how much noise life makes when you stop adding to it.  \n\nIn the afternoon, I opened the bag of medications: two heart pills, one diuretic, and a small white tablet for anxiety if his breathing spiked again. Each one represented a bargain — a promise that chemistry could lend him more time. I crushed them gently into food, wondering if he understood what we were doing. He ate slowly, deliberately, tail wagging once in acknowledgment.  \n\nBy evening, he’d retreated into the couch cushion corner that had always been his sanctuary. The same spot where he’d watched us through a thousand ordinary nights. Now it felt different — sacred, somehow. His breathing stayed even, his eyes half-closed, his body heavy with medicine and relief.  \n\nKiyomi and I moved quietly through the evening routines. Dishes, emails, a quick call to Sage to confirm the dosage schedule. They were pleased with his progress — “twenty-four is excellent,” the nurse said. I nodded, though she couldn’t see me, and whispered thank you as if the words might ripple back through the line and bless whoever answered.  \n\nLater, around ten, we gave him his second dose. He took it with the same calm as before. I turned off the lights, left a single lamp glowing in the corner, and sat on the floor beside him. He looked up once, then sighed — that deep, contented sigh dogs give when they know they’re safe. It broke me a little.  \n\nThe house smelled faintly of medicine and lavender detergent. Outside, the city murmured — distant cars, someone laughing on the sidewalk, a plane overhead. Inside, only breathing. In and out, slow and steady. I realized how many nights I’d taken that sound for granted.  \n\nAt one point, I thought about the hospital again. The way the vet’s eyes softened when she told us his heart was enlarged. “He’s lived a long, good life,” she said, and I remember wanting to argue with her — not about the diagnosis, but about the idea of finality. Why must love always be translated into years? Why not into moments, breaths, or the quiet in between?  \n\nIt’s strange, the thoughts that visit you in the dark. I found myself tracing the edge between science and faith. The pills worked, yes, but there was something else at play — something the vet couldn’t measure: mercy.  \n\nKiyomi came to sit beside me. We didn’t speak. We just watched him sleep. It felt like waiting, though for what exactly I couldn’t say — maybe for the dawn, maybe for the next breath, maybe for the courage to keep doing this, one day at a time.  \n\nSomewhere after midnight, I nodded off. When I woke, his head was resting on my leg. I could feel his heartbeat through the blanket — slow, steady, deliberate. The rhythm of survival.  \n\nMorning light was already seeping through the curtains. Another day. Whiskers stretched, yawned, blinked, and wagged his tail. It was such an ordinary gesture that it felt miraculous.  \n\nThe long night had passed. Waiting had turned into being.  \n\nAnd in that fragile transformation, something in us healed too — not completely, not forever, but enough. Enough to greet the new day without fear. Enough to believe that sometimes rest, medicine, and love can conspire to give us one more sunrise.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination.
