## 🍏📱 The iPhone Sock — Fiat Culture’s Final Form

**Apple:** “What if… hear us out… what if we sold people a *sock* for their phone?”  
**Fiat Consumer Base:** “Take my $230.”

This is it.  
This is the moment historians will point to and say:

> “Yes, this is when the empire collapsed.”

## 🧦 Introducing the iPhone Sock
- No protection  
- No function  
- No features  
- *But it’s Apple-branded*  

It’s literally a **$1,200 device in a $2 AliExpress pouch marked up to $230.**

Peak innovation.

## 🦹 The New “Phone Replacement Incentive Program”
Some people are saying Apple figured this out:

1. Wrap your phone in a slippery sock  
2. Make it easy to snatch  
3. Let nature take its course  
4. Sell you a new $1,400 iPhone (starting at $1,799 with optional charging cable)

AppleCare?  
More like **Apple Don’tCare**  
– you’ll just buy another phone.

## 💸 Fiat Psychology 101
Why does this work?

Because fiat culture trains people to believe:
- $230 for fabric = normal  
- “Minimalist design” = “we removed everything you actually need”  
- Vulnerability = luxury  
- “Premium lifestyle accessory” = “we made a sock”

If this were Bitcoin standard, it would be satire.  
Under fiat?  
It’s a *product line.*

## 🎭 The Theatre of Prestige
Case: protects your phone  
Sock: protects Apple’s margins  

Case: hides the logo  
Sock: **preserves the sacred Apple reveal ritual** whenever you pull it out in public

You’re not buying a pouch.  
You’re buying a *moment.*

## ⚡ Meanwhile in Bitcoin Land…
Bitcoiners:  
“Here is an open monetary network that ends global rent-seeking and restores sovereignty.”

Fiat world:  
“Bro check out my $230 fabric sheath for my pocket supercomputer.”

## 📉 Civilization: declining  
## 📈 Sock margins: rising

You couldn’t script it better.
