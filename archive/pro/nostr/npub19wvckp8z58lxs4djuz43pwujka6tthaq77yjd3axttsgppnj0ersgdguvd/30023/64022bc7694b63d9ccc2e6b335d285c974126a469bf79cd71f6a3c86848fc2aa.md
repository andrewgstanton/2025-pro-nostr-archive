## **How I Built a Decentralized CMS with Nostr + GitHub Actions**

🧡 *My first post on a fully sovereign blog.*

### Introduction

This blog post isn’t hosted on Medium, Substack, or WordPress.\
It doesn’t live on a database I don’t control.\
There’s no login, no admin panel, no SaaS dashboard.

Instead, this post was published as a Nostr event —\
stored on dozens of relays,\
fetched with open-source scripts,\
rendered as a static HTML file,\
and served globally via GitHub Pages.

And it all runs without a single server I have to manage.

Let me show you how it works — and why this matters.

### Step 1: Writing on Nostr

I use [Primal.net](https://primal.net) to write my articles.\
Their long-form editor lets you add titles, summaries, and tags to a special kind of Nostr event (`30023`).\
You just click publish — and the article propagates across the Nostr network.

### Step 2: Fetching Events

On my GitHub repo, I maintain a script called `fetch_articles.py`.\
It connects to multiple Nostr relays (like `relay.damus.io`, `relay.primal.net`, `nostr.mom`, etc.) and fetches any articles I've written using my public key.\
Only posts tagged with `blog` or `article` are kept.

Each article is:

* Deduplicated

* Parsed for title, summary, image, tags, and content

* Converted from Markdown to clean HTML

* Saved in a static folder

### Step 3: Hosting with GitHub Pages

The output goes straight into the `docs/` folder of my public GitHub repository.\
Thanks to GitHub Pages, the site is instantly deployed as a static website.

The homepage (`index.html`) uses JavaScript to read `articles/index.json` and display the 10 most recent blog posts — each linking to its full static HTML page.

### Step 4: Fully Automated via GitHub Actions

To keep things fresh, I created a GitHub Action called `Fetch and Build Articles`.\
It runs daily — or whenever I trigger it manually — and fetches new content from Nostr, updates the site, and redeploys everything.

No databases.\
No plugins.\
No backend headaches.\
Just content — and the open protocols that carry it.

### Why This Matters

Most blogs are brittle.\
Lose your password, your server, or your platform — and your voice disappears.

This setup flips that on its head:

* **I own my content** — It's stored on a public, censorship-resistant network.

* **Anyone can verify it** — The data lives on Nostr relays, signed with my pubkey.

* **It costs nothing to host** — GitHub Pages serves everything statically.

* **It’s future-proof** — If GitHub disappeared, I could mirror the repo anywhere.

This is what publishing *should* look like in 2025.

### Want to Build Your Own?

You can fork the repo I use [here](https://github.com/andrewgstanton/blog-stantonweb-site) —\
or read the code and set it up for your own Nostr pubkey.

This is just the beginning.\
One post, one block, one step at a time —\
on our own terms.
