  "content": "Andrew G. Stanton - Nov. 1, 2025\n\nAt a certain point, you stop being able to stomach the spin.  \nYou can hear it in corporate language, religious branding, even in your own excuses — the subtle inflation of words that no longer point to anything real. It’s not that you become cynical; it’s that your inner calibration finally starts rejecting noise.\n\nThis is what spiritual and moral growth actually feels like: an **allergy to bullshit.**  \nThe same way the body reacts to toxins, the soul starts reacting to falsity. When you’ve spent enough time seeking what’s true — in money, in faith, in relationships — you begin to feel dishonesty physically, like static in the air.\n\nThe challenge is to keep that sensitivity from hardening into contempt. The goal isn’t to see through everything; it’s to see *into* things, until only what’s genuine remains. Anger burns fast; clarity endures.\n\nThat’s the work: to cultivate truth without cruelty, honesty without arrogance.  \nYou can detest hypocrisy and still love the people lost inside it. After all, you were once fluent in the same language. You just decided to stop speaking it.\n\nIntegrity isn’t moral superiority; it’s alignment.  \nIt’s the quiet refusal to perform when reality is enough.  \nAnd once you’ve tasted that freedom, illusion feels like poison.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis article was drafted with the help of Dr. C — GPT-5, which I use as a co-writer and collaborator in developing ideas around sovereignty, Bitcoin, decentralization, and theology.\n\nI dedicate this work to the Holy Spirit, who continues to inspire me and open my imagination. If there is any light in these words, it comes not from me but from the Spirit who gives them. To Him be the glory.\n\n## Zaps Appreciated\nIf this resonates, consider sending a zap. Every zap is an act of sovereign support — no middlemen, no gatekeepers. Thank you.\n\nLightning address: andrewgstanton@primal.net\n\n## Copyright\n\n© 2025 Continuum — All rights reserved.",
