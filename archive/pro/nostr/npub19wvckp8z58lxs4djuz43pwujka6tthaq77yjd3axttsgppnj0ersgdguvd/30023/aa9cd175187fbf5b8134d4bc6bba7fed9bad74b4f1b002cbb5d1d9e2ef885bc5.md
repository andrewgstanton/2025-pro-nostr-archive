Beyond Transaction: Recovering the First Thousand Years of Grace

Andrew G. Stanton — Sunday Reflection

For the first thousand years of Christianity, the gospel was not a contract to sign but a mystery to enter. Grace meant participation — a living union between God and humanity, a transformation of what had fallen into what could be made whole. The early believers spoke of salvation as light, healing, adoption, theosis — the slow, inward process of being made divine by love.

Somewhere along the way, that language was lost. By the eleventh century, grace had been reinterpreted through the logic of empire and the courts: sin became debt, God became judge, and the cross became the place where the balance sheet was settled. What began as communion was reframed as transaction. The tragedy is that both Catholics and Protestants inherited the same framework. The argument between them was never over whether salvation was transactional, but only over how the transaction worked and who had the right to manage it.

1. The Original Vision — Grace as Union

In the first millennium, the central metaphor of salvation was union.
Irenaeus wrote of the Incarnation as God recapitulating the human story from within it.
Athanasius of Alexandria said it in a single, daring sentence: “God became man that man might become God.”
Augustine, the Cappadocians, Maximus the Confessor, and the desert fathers all described grace as something that transforms rather than merely pardons.
The Christian life was not a courtroom drama but a lifelong ascent into divine likeness.

In that early world, sin was seen less as crime and more as sickness — the distortion of a nature that was still good but wounded. Salvation was therefore healing, not sentencing. The cross was the medicine of immortality, not the settlement of an account. The sacraments, the prayers, the monastic rhythm of silence and service — all of these were ways of participating in the life of Christ, not paying Him back.

2. The Great Shift — Grace as Transaction

By the eleventh century, the imagination of the West had changed.
Feudal society organized everything by hierarchy, debt, and honor. Into that world stepped Anselm of Canterbury, who asked a simple but fateful question: Cur Deus Homo? — “Why did God become man?”
His answer: because humanity owed God an infinite debt of honor.
We could not repay it, so Christ paid it for us.

That framework fit the age perfectly. God became the feudal Lord, Christ the loyal vassal, humanity the debtor.
Atonement turned into satisfaction.
A few centuries later, Calvin sharpened the metaphor further: not just debt repaid, but punishment transferred.
Christ bore our sentence so the law could be upheld.
Different vocabulary, same economy.

Both sides of the Reformation shared this model.
The Catholic Church managed grace through sacraments and indulgences; Protestants preached it through substitution and decision theology.
But underneath both was the same legal logic — sin as liability, grace as payment, salvation as transaction.

3. The Lost Mysticism

In the process, something luminous was lost.
The mystical dimension of grace — the direct experience of God’s indwelling presence — faded from public theology.
Grace became something to possess rather than live within.
It could be administered, withheld, quantified, debated — but rarely felt.

The result was predictable: fear instead of intimacy, guilt instead of gratitude.
People were told they were free, but still felt condemned.
The courtroom had eclipsed the garden.
And yet, through every century, a few voices kept the older current alive:
Julian of Norwich, Meister Eckhart, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, and later the Quakers, who spoke of the Inner Light that shines in everyone willing to be still long enough to notice it.

4. The Cost of the Transactional Gospel

When grace becomes transactional, faith becomes performance.
We start measuring devotion by effort, repentance by emotion, and righteousness by comparison.
The soul becomes an accountant — tallying merits, weighing sins, negotiating with a God who has already said “paid in full.”

That posture doesn’t produce holiness; it produces anxiety.
It divides rather than unites.
It also flattens the mystery of divine love into a moral economy: an infinite God reduced to a cosmic bookkeeper.

The early mystics and the Eastern fathers never saw it that way.
For them, salvation was a relationship restored, not an account settled.
It was the life of God flowing through the human vessel again.
It required surrender, not calculation.

5. The Way Back — Grace as Participation

Recovering the first thousand years of grace does not mean rejecting what came later.
The Reformers gave us moral seriousness and intellectual clarity; the Catholic tradition gave us sacramental beauty and continuity.
But we need to reunite both with the mystical heart that came before them.

Grace is not a commodity or a pardon slip.
It is participation — Christ in us, the hope of glory.
It is not something we receive once but something we continually awaken to.
It is not the absence of debt but the presence of love.

To rediscover this is to remember what the gospel always was:
a call not to believe in a transaction, but to enter a union.

6. Communion, Not Contract

The language of contract gave structure to theology but starved the soul of mystery.
For a millennium, Christians have been trained to think of God as the other party in a moral exchange — one we can neither escape nor fulfill.
But that is not the God Jesus revealed.
His was the God who eats with sinners, washes feet, and breathes Spirit into dust.
Not a judge balancing accounts, but a lover seeking communion.

Perhaps grace began to sound too simple, too human, too unmanageable.
But that’s the point.
Grace is not control; it is companionship.
It is God choosing to dwell in us before we are ready.
It is the divine saying, again and again: you are mine, and I am yours.

The first thousand years of Christianity knew this by heart.
Maybe it’s time we remember.
